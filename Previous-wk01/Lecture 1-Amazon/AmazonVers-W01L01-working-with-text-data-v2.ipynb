       "      <td>I Got What I Paid For: After getting an estimate on how much it would cost to have a \"professional\" clean our sofa &amp; love seat I decided to do it myself, so purchased this cleaner.  I chose this Hoover based on the many Amazon reviews I read, price, and reputation of the maker.\\nIt arrived on time, packaging was great (thanks Amazon!) and the cleaner was in brand new-never used condition, just what I ordered.  I was a bit concerned about how hard it would be to assemble after reading that some people had a hard time with this.  I am not the greatest at putting things together myself, and I agree--the instruction book IS somewhat confusing.  (not to mention the tiny type, which makes it very difficult to read)\\nWhat I did, and I suggest this to everyone, is to look at the video instructions on YouTube.  They are great.  I followed those and used the print manual at the same time and did not have a bit of trouble.  (but I know I would have not been able to put it together with just the manual alone)\\nIt is true,as many have mentioned--the cleaner is totally plastic!  The downside of this means parts could break easily I am sure.  Plus side of the plastic--it is lightweight and easy to move around.  The plastic hopefully won't be as much of an issue for me as this cleaner is not going to be used a lot.  We don't have carpet.  I got it just to do furniture and a couple of area rugs, and unless there are \"accidents\" don't think I will need to use it very often.  Last night I cleaned the sofa and love seat and was amazed at the dirt this cleaner sucked up!  (had no idea my dark burgundy furniture was so filthy!)  Very easy to attach the appliance used for cleaning upholstry, it got the fabric wet enough to clean it, and sucked up the dirty water very well, so the furniture dried quickly, felt and looked great! (by the way, not a bit of leaking from the tanks, so this was not at all messy for me to operate)  It was very late so I only did a portion of an area rug just to test it, and it looks like I will have equally good results there as well.  In the future I plan to use it on our ceramic tile porch floor, and as other reviewers have mentioned, am going to try doing that without  purchasing the additional \"bare floor\" attachment after reading that you can do floors without it...\\nAfter cleaning my furniture I was very careful to clean out the tanks, and hose.  Since this is not an expensive cleaner, and considering what it is made of I am sure that taking time to clean it well after each use is important.\\nI gave this four stars because like many others, I am not pleased that it is called a \"steam vac\" when it actually is not.  (and I don't care how hot the water is, this machine is not going to \"steam\")  Anyone not doing their research could easily be fooled into thinking this is a real steam cleaner, so shame on Hoover for naming it as one!  All in all I am happy with this cleaner, but would have wanted something more \"sturdy\" if I had a lot of carpets--messes to clean.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Read tips before use, but overall great product: I purchased this Hoover carpet cleaner, because of all the great reviews on here.  I really like this carpet cleaner, and it really helped my poor tan colored carpet.  I have a dog, two cats, toddler, husband, and I personally am a beverage spiller.\\n\\nPros: High suction, not too heavy, cleans well.\\nCons: cord is too short (we use an extension cord to make is easier) Uses a lot of cleaner solution (definitely use the tip that another reviewer posted about using the rinse on the floor first, because this helps A TON), and the tanks both clean and dirty water are just too small (lots of filling and dumping).\\n\\nI know my cons list looks long, but overall, the cleaner did a really good job.  I haven't gotten a chance to use all of the attachments yet, but we did use the stair tool, and that worked very well.  I have quite happy with this carpet cleaner.  I would recommend it to others.\\n\\n***Did not purchase from Amazon, purchased from Khols</td>\n",

The shampoo were made my carpets look Brian knew it took out the stains if left a map it looks great there's scrubbing brushes on the bottom of the thing to kind of scrub the carpet and fluff it up as you're going...\\n\\nTo shampoo the stairs in furniture it comes with 3 different attachmentsDepending on which one you want to use 1 has a scrubber with the circular motion and the other 2 don't.\\n\\nMy stairs look brand new after I got done using the attachment.\\n\\nI definitely recommend the shampooer if you're looking for something to make your carpet amazing.\\n\\nIt is self propelling and light weight.\n",
       "2  I Got What I Paid For: After getting an estimate on how much it would cost to have a \"professional\" clean our sofa & love seat I decided to do it myself, so purchased this cleaner.  I chose this Hoover based on the many Amazon reviews I read, price, and reputation of the maker.\\nIt arrived on time, packaging was great (thanks Amazon!) and the cleaner was in brand new-never used condition, just what I ordered.  I was a bit concerned about how hard it would be to assemble after reading that some people had a hard time with this.  I am not the greatest at putting things together myself, and I agree--the instruction book IS somewhat confusing.  (not to mention the tiny type, which makes it very difficult to read)\\nWhat I did, and I suggest this to everyone, is to look at the video instructions on YouTube.  They are great.  I followed those and used the print manual at the same time and did not have a bit of trouble.  (but I know I would have not been able to put it together with just the manual alone)\\nIt is true,as many have mentioned--the cleaner is totally plastic!  The downside of this means parts could break easily I am sure.  Plus side of the plastic--it is lightweight and easy to move around.  The plastic hopefully won't be as much of an issue for me as this cleaner is not going to be used a lot.  We don't have carpet.  I got it just to do furniture and a couple of area rugs, and unless there are \"accidents\" don't think I will need to use it very often.  Last night I cleaned the sofa and love seat and was amazed at the dirt this cleaner sucked up!  (had no idea my dark burgundy furniture was so filthy!)  Very easy to attach the appliance used for cleaning upholstry, it got the fabric wet enough to clean it, and sucked up the dirty water very well, so the furniture dried quickly, felt and looked great! (by the way, not a bit of leaking from the tanks, so this was not at all messy for me to operate)  It was very late so I only did a portion of an area rug just to test it, and it looks like I will have equally good results there as well.  In the future I plan to use it on our ceramic tile porch floor, and as other reviewers have mentioned, am going to try doing that without  purchasing the additional \"bare floor\" attachment after reading that you can do floors without it...\\nAfter cleaning my furniture I was very careful to clean out the tanks, and hose.  Since this is not an expensive cleaner, and considering what it is made of I am sure that taking time to clean it well after each use is important.\\nI gave this four stars because like many others, I am not pleased that it is called a \"steam vac\" when it actually is not.  (and I don't care how hot the water is, this machine is not going to \"steam\")  Anyone not doing their research could easily be fooled into thinking this is a real steam cleaner, so shame on Hoover for naming it as one!  All in all I am happy with this cleaner, but would have wanted something more \"sturdy\" if I had a lot of carpets--messes to clean.\n",

I really like this carpet cleaner, and it really helped my poor tan colored carpet.  I have a dog, two cats, toddler, husband, and I personally am a beverage spiller.\\n\\nPros: High suction, not too heavy, cleans well.\\nCons: cord is too short (we use an extension cord to make is easier) Uses a lot of cleaner solution (definitely use the tip that another reviewer posted about using the rinse on the floor first, because this helps A TON), and the tanks both clean and dirty water are just too small (lots of filling and dumping).\\n\\nI know my cons list looks long, but overall, the cleaner did a really good job.  I haven't gotten a chance to use all of the attachments yet, but we did use the stair tool, and that worked very well.  I have quite happy with this carpet cleaner.

I logged in to buy her the exact same one as mine, because it's the best :) But then I saw this slightly improved model.  It weighs less, and a few pounds make a difference after an hour of cleaning the carpets. The waste-water tank on this one now has a pour spout.  Not a deal breaker, but I thought it was nice . My mother found it difficult to open, and ended up taking the whole cover off each time anyhow (like mine).  But she LOVES this thing.  Just moved into a new place, and this costs less that the pro's and does a better job.  Amazing little machine. She's very excited to do her other rooms.</td>\n",

Let it charge, then pull it out and set it aside until you need it.\\n\\nAlso, don't be lazy: dump out the dust bin after every use.

I like this cleaner; the brushes seem to spin well, it sucks the dirty solution out of the carpet; it is easy to move and carry from the storage room. I use to rent a cleaner or have it professionally cleaned but decided using a machine that has been in who knows what type of house cleaning all types of dirty carpet was not an option anymore. I bought this for about the price I would pay to rent a machine 3 times or have a professional cleaner come out once.\\n\\nOverall I am happy with this.

I logged in to buy her the exact same one as mine, because it's the best :) But then I saw this slightly improved model.  It weighs less, and a few pounds make a difference after an hour of cleaning the carpets. The waste-water tank on this one now has a pour spout.  Not a deal breaker, but I thought it was nice . My mother found it difficult to open, and ended up taking the whole cover off each time anyhow (like mine).  But she LOVES this thing.  Just moved into a new place, and this costs less that the pro's and does a better job.  Amazing little machine. She's very excited to do her other rooms.   \n",

I've had it for a year now and am extremely pleased. While I still use a heavy-duty Rainbow canister vacuum for deep cleaning, this wireless Hoover has taken the chore out of regular dusting, sweeping, and general floor cleaning, for both my high-traffic carpet and kitchen floor.\\n\\nI have a cat and can vouch for the ability of this Hoover unit to handle pet fur well.\\n\\nTwo things to note: 1) Follow everyone else's advice here about the battery: that is, buy an extra one (http://www.amazon.com/Hoover-LiNX-Lithium-Battery-BH50000/dp/B0020MLAR8/), so you can swap it out rapidly, and 2) again, as recommended here and by Hoover, don't store your spare battery in the charger! Let it charge, then pull it out and set it aside until you need it.\\n\\nAlso, don't be lazy: dump out the dust bin after every use. It just takes a few seconds, and the unit is MUCH more effective when it can \"breathe\".   \n",

       "      <td>Lightweight.....: Our carpet had been neglected for a while. We always rented a Rug Doctor and it was becoming quite a hassle to pick it up and return it. Lifting it in and out of our car's trunk was another hassle we wanted to do away with.  I purchased the Hoover F5914-900 after reading the reviews. It was easy to assemble.\\n\\nThis steam cleaner is much smaller &amp; lighter than the Rug Doctor we are used to using, making it easier to push &amp; maneuver around. However, because of the smaller size, we  emptied and filled the upper and lower tanks, eight times while cleaning our 12'x 26' carpet. The clean solution tank holds one gallon of water (one reason for the light weight). The instructions say to fill it with hot tap water and the detergent which is easily measured using the tank's cap as a measuring cup.  The unit itself cleans about a 11-11.5\" wide area and doesn't clean close enough to the woodwork to suit me. So, I used the stair/upholstery nozzle to clean next to the woodwork and other tight areas. That tool did a good job for us. Hooking it up was a bit confusing and my hubby was worried that he was going to break the clear, recovery tank front panel. It pulls down a little hard, just don't force it. There is also a powered hand tool that has rotating brushes included with this steam vac.  I didn't feel the need to try out this unit's Clean Surge feature because I had already pre-treated the bad areas.\\n\\nVacuum your carpeting before steam cleaning otherwise you'll end up clogging the steam cleaner. I pretreated the heavy traffic areas with my&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bissell-0801-Oxy-Gen2-Booster/dp/B000RH0JGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Bissell 0801 Oxy Gen2 Booster&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which I applied liberally to the carpet and waited 10 minutes before steam cleaning.  For stubborn areas, I pre-treat, steam clean, let dry, pre-treat again, steam clean, let dry, then rinse. For normal cleaning, I pre-treat, steam clean, let dry, then rinse.  I'm happy with the results. The heavy traffic areas are now the same color as the rest of my carpet. This time I around I used&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-40321128-Deep-Cleansing-Carpet-Upholstery-Detergent-128-Ounce/dp/B0002B8LIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover 40321128 Deep Cleansing Carpet/Upholstery Detergent, 128-Ounce&lt;/a&gt;. I might try another brand of steam cleaning detergent next time.\\n\\nTake good care of your steam cleaner. Be sure to read the instruction booklet &amp; be sure to follow the storage instructions when you put it away after cleaning your carpet.\\n\\nSo far so good; we are both pleased with our Hoover SteamVac. Because of the steam vac's light weight, we are not exhausted after cleaning our carpets.  The Hoover did a good job of picking up the water, but it took our carpet more than 2 hours to dry.</td>\n",

I have been wanting a steam cleaner for years now but just never broke down and purchased one. So when I saw this one go on sale, and it had good reviews, I said to myself Well why not?! and purchased it haha.\\n\\nI am very glad I did. I feel like it was a pretty good buy and it was super easy to put together. It sat in its box in our laundry room for a week and a half or so before I decided to put it together. I procrastinated putting it together because I figured there would be a lot of parts and it would take me awhile. This is the first steam cleaner I have ever owned so I just wasn't sure how much of my time it would take up to assemble it. It went together in less than 5 minutes  it was that easy! Now I feel silly for waiting to get it out of the box haha.\\n\\nI have used this machine three times so far. The first time I tested it on one black stain on our floor that had popped up just a few days prior. It was already pretty late at night when I put it together but I wanted to see how well it worked on a stain and also make sure it wasn't going to mess the carpet up etc.\\n\\nI wish I would have taken a before and after photo of the stain it pulled out of the carpet to show you a comparison because it was literally one of the only stains we had on our carpet. We just got our new home a year and a half ago and we don't let our children run around the house with food, we always take our shoes off at the door etc. So our carpet was already in pretty decent shape as far as stains go.\\n\\nAnyway, I was pleasantly surprised the first time I tested it out. The stain came out with ease and I decided that the next morning I was going to do our childrens rooms.\\n\\nThis steam cleaner comes with 16 ounces of starter solution that smells so nice and clean when you are done too. I also love how it comes with extra cleaning tools in a mesh bag with a hook on the top that way you can hang it up when not in use. It comes with the following tools:\\n\\n-SpinScrub Powered Hand Tool\\n-Stair Tool\\n-Upholstery Tool\\n-Crevice Tool\\n-16 oz. Solution\\n-Mesh Tool Storage Bag\\n\\nLike I said, we don't really have much on the floor as far as stains go, but check out the water I dumped after doing our sons room. It definitely pulled out a lot of dirt and other things from the carpet:\\n\\nBy this point, I was getting super excited about this Hoover Carpet Cleaner. I texted my husband about it and said, \"How sad is it that I am so excited about this LOL?!\" Ahhhhh Adulting. Funsies.\\n\\nThen I did our toddler girls room as well as our bedroom that day. The next day I decided to tackle our living room. We spend most of our time in there when we are home so naturally the water was definitely dirtier.\\n\\nAs I was cleaning our living room, I started to find these nasty clumps of hair/dirt/who knows what else on the floor. I assume it is just gunk and hair that was tangled up in the scrubbing brushes, but yeah, gross! I have included pics of them.\\n\\nOverall, I love this steam cleaner and I am very satisfied with it so far. The 16 oz of solution only did two rooms (two kids rooms and I barely finished) so I did end up having my husband bring home some more solution from the store.</td>\n",

I read a few reviews from people who received used machines.  When I unpacked the unit, it seemed to have more scratches than one would expect with a new machine.  However, the main reason I think mine might be used is because the measuring cup, and in particular the black ring that surrounds it, are covered in a white powdery substance that MAY be dried detergent.  Also, the underside of the lid of the water tank has a bit of a brown, sticky-looking substance.  I've included a short clip of the measuring cup.  Before I go through the hassle of returning this, can anyone who purchased this machine tell me if their cup had this white substance on it?</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is really a BIG improvement!: Hoover LiNX Cordless Stick Vac (Model BH50010) List $179.99 (3/17/09)\\n\\nPros:\\nCleans well - on/off brushroll for bare floors or area rugs/carpeting, excellent on pet hair\\nControl on handle - easy to use\\nCharge indicator accurate &amp; useful\\nDust cup very easy to empty &amp; clean (including baffle tube when necessary)\\nFilter easy to clean\\nStands up to store\\n\\nCons:\\nAwkward on stairs - no stair-handle, must support from below. I'm getting used to this, and it's easier if I use my stronger hand for the machine and weaker hand for the handle.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\\nHoover Platinum CSV is absolutely shines in two areas: ease of use (switching from brushroll on to brushroll off, going between surface heights &amp; types), and cleaning ability, especially the tricky maneuver of getting pet hair off area rugs.\\n\\nWORD TO THE WISE:\\nI got this information from Hoover after my battery failed: don't store the battery in the charger. (I stored it in the charger and only took it out of the charger when I used it.)  There is nothing in the instructions about this, but storing it in the charger can cause it to fail. It's OK to leave it several hours or overnight, but then take it out of the charger and put it in the vacuum.  The battery will continue to hold the full charge no matter how long it is stored in the vacuum. (Thanks to the 2 year warranty on the battery, they are sending me a new one at no charge.)\\n\\nRead on if you are interested in more detailed comments:\\n\\nPrice:\\nI am sure that with time the price will come down or discounts will be available from the $179 list.  I know that the Hoover Platinum Lightweight Bagged Upright (another model in this line) which originally listed for $399 is readily available online for $300 now.  (Nov 12, 2009 edit: Price has finally dropped into the $150 range!)\\n\\nBattery Life:\\nThe battery life is quite good, and I like the \"fade-free\" aspect of the product - it works at full power for the whole time.  It does a much better job so much quicker than my old vac and I am more than satisfied, since I can get everything I want done in a single charge.\\n\\nBagless feature:\\nI think I finally understand why bagless vacuums are so popular, even though they are more work: there is something so satisfying about SEEING how much dirt and pet hair you have removed from your flooring. But however satisfying it is to see what you have removed, it creates an extra step that you need to perform nearly every time you use a bagless vac - ANY bagless vac - if you want it to maintain its cleaning power.  With my previous stick vac, the dust cup emptied fine, but I had to pull the dust off the filter with my fingers to ready it for the next use, and occasionally use another vacuum to clean the filter because it was not washable.  The Hoover Platinum CSV, however, is exceptionally easy to empty and clean. The dust cup empties from the bottom, the baffle tube is easy to remove from the dust cup assembly if necessary (which it will be, if you have multiple long-haired daughters), and the filter can be bushed off with a dry toothbrush and washed when necessary. Long hair does tend to wind around the baffle tube (part of the bagless system).  Fortunately, that is easy to remove when emptying the dust cup.\\n\\nCarpet Cleaning:\\nI have used (and liked, and still believe it is a good stick vac, although with limitations) the Eureka The Boss Lite Cordless (96 b)&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Eureka-96-B-Quick-Up-Upright-Cordless-Stick-Vacuum/dp/B00004VWIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Eureka 96 B Quick Up Upright Cordless Stick Vacuum&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;cordless (rated 4  stars on Amazon) for years on my hardwood floors and area rugs for quick cleanups, so I have a basis for comparison.\\n\\nMy old Boss Lite was great on bare floors, but only better-than-nothing on rugs. (I used to kneel down and wipe the surface with a well-wrung out sponge to get the hair off my area rugs because the brush-roll on the Eureka just wasn't up to it.)  By comparison, the Hoover Platinum Cordless Stick Vac is amazingly good at getting surface pet hair, dirt, and sock lint off rugs.  It won't deep clean, but it will help to make the carpet surface LOOK clean, which is all I want for a quick clean up.\\n\\nEase of use:\\nEasily goes from one surface to another seamlessly, except for certain very lightweight mats.  Rubber backed bathmats and doormats require me to lift the vacuum up off the bare floor and onto the rug, but it does a good job on those at cleaning them rather than sucking them up. It cannot be used on the very lightest towel-weight throw rugs with no backing, even without the brushroll - it sucks them up. With ordinary area rugs, however, the Hoover Platinum CSV goes up and over the edge with amazing ease.\\n\\nEdge cleaning:\\nThis vacuum has excellent edge cleaning.  I don't ever have to stoop down to get that random bit of whatever from near the baseboard.  This is a MAJOR plus when compared to my old stick vac.\\n\\nClearance:\\nThe Hoover Platinum CSV will go under about the first 9 inches of furniture with only about 2  inches of clearance,- you can't go further than that, because the bagless dust cup gets in the way.  But if you have more clearance - about 8 inches (what my kitchen chairs have under the crossbars between the legs)- then you can get completely under.\\n\\nWas there anything I liked BETTER about the my old stick vac?\\nYes, I liked the way it hung on the wall to charge. The Hoover has a charging base which charges the battery, and the vac, while it stands on its own (a plus), does require floor space.</td>\n",

That was on Friday afternoon, on the bedroom rug, which was a lot filthier than I could've imagined. We have two dogs. One is very old and prone to accidents, the other is just stubborn and likes to pee on the spots where I thought I'd cleaned up the accidents. I've used a Bissel Spot cleaner every time one of the pups misbehaves on the rug, but when I saw this on sale I had to try it.\\n\\nI spent about two hours working on the bedroom carpet. I watched as the muck and grime of fecal filth and city soot shot up through suction tube and into the waste tank, it was so gratifying that I didn't care about the blisters forming on my right hand. The carpet was so much filthier than I could've imagined. The proof was right there in the tank. I cleaned the entire thing five times, refilled the hot water and detergent tanks ten times, and emptied the dirty water container three times. It was fantastic!\\n\\nMy problem started when I tried cleaning the hallway rug and the suction stopped working. I checked all the lids and latches. Everything seemed to be exactly as it was when I was attacking the bedroom rug, but no suction, no waves of muck pouring into the waste tank. All I had was a very wet and kinda stinky front hallway rug, blisters on my right hand from pushing and pulling the machine for so many hours, and a horrible headache from listening to the hold music on the 800 number for Hoover customer service. I had attempted to call them twice; the first time I was on hold for 15 minutes before I gave up, the second time I lasted 27 minutes listening to the same crappy Mozart recording.\\n\\nMy service representative patiently walked me through all the steps I'd already taken on my own, then finally concluded that the machine needed to go to the repair shop. I live in Manhattan, every authorized repair shop is on the Bronx or Queens. This machine is bulky and weighs at least 60 lbs, at least it feels like it does. It's like an overgrown R2D2 with a handle and removable tanks. Cab fare to the Bronx or Queens would cost more than the machine, and there's no way I could schlepp it over to the subway station and down all those steps to wait on a crowded platform then ride on a crowded train only to have to walk it through streets in a neighborhood far, far away. I told her I'd rather throw it away. I almost started to cry. My hands were sore and stiff and my front carpet was sopping wet. And my husband had thrown out the box so I couldn't return it to Amazon.\\n\\nBut then Sheila, my wonderful TTI Floor Care service rep, spoke to her supervisor. I didn't hear that conversation, but she managed to get authorization to send me a brand new unit. She told me to cut the cord and email her a picture.\\n\\nCutting the cord felt cruel, like an execution. I couldn't do it. So I waited until I was less emotional, which rarely happens. The next morning the machine was still plugged into the outlet in my hallway. I wheeled it into my kitchen, where the rug is thinner and would dry faster if my final attempt to run the machine on a small un-trafficked corner of the carpet failed. I flipped on the power switch and hit the solution release trigger. Right away I got that ultra-satisfying whoosh of dirty water gushing into the waste tank (see video below). It was beautiful. I moved all the furniture off the kitchen carpet and shampooed all of it. I emptied the waste tank, refilled the water tank and went over it again. And then the suction stopped working and I had a sopping wet kitchen rug.\\n\\nThe execution was quick and painless. With any luck the blisters on my right hand will have healed by the time the replacement arrives. I will definitely wear cotton gloves when I use it.</td>\n",

I let the warm water and Nature's Miracle soak for a few minutes. I then do one full swoop on wash. Finally, I do a few swoops on rinse, only pressing the trigger while moving forward - not backward. If you need to get rid of the excess moisture in the carpets, continue to do slow-moving swoops without pressing the trigger (as that's what releases more \"water\"/solution) and the cleaner will suck out the excess liquid.\\n\\nTip: Unless you're cleaning a very large area of carpet, you likely do not need to fill up the solution part more than half way with this method.</td>\n",

My kids' carpets are newer and cleaner and when there is a stain, I pull out the steam vac and it does a great job. The price is good and it is simple to operate.

Because the carpets are wool, I didn't use super hot water.  Others said the machine worked well with half the amount of detergent that Hoover calls for.  It did work well, tho I had to pre-treat really dirty areas, as expected.  I didn't use the brushes because the carpets are delicate, but still got a LOT of dirt out.  I kept my \"wet\" passes down to two as recommended, used four \"dry\" passes, and put washed out plastic milk cartons under the damp carpet to facilitate drying with the help of a box fan.  The rugs felt dry in about four hours, but I kept the fans going overnight for the sake of the wood floor. Be sure to read Lissie's detailed review of the machine and avoid problems.  You'll save the purchase price pretty quickly, but I'll do it sooner since the price I paid is almost $20 less than the current one, and I got free shipping.  I haven't used the upholstery cleaning ability yet, but expect it will be quite respectable, too.

       "      <td>a good Hoover product: In addition to two people, our home has four pets.  The frequent accidents that the residents of my house make on our light beige carpet necessitate a good carpet cleaner.\\n\\nWe had a Bissell ProHeat 2x that served us fairly well for 3-4 years, but, eventually portions of its plastic exterior began breaking off and water started seeping where it was not supposed to seep.  The design of the Bissell ProHeat was also poor.  After purchasing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Platinum-Lightweight-Upright-Vacuum-with-Canister-Bagged-UH30010COM/dp/B001PB8EEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover Platinum Lightweight Upright Vacuum with Canister, Bagged, UH30010COM&lt;/a&gt;and loving its design and abilities, my husband and I decided we would pick a Hoover to replace the Bissell.\\n\\nAssembly of this product is pretty easy; all you need is a Phillips head screwdriver to assemble the products and its various pieces.  The assembly process takes about ten minutes.  Almost everything on the Hoover SteamVac is plastic, which was kind of disappointing after our purchase of the Hoover Platinum vacuum, which employs a solid metal frame.  At this price point for a carpet cleaner, I guess it is not unexpected to have a machine that is a little less sturdy.\\n\\nIn comparing the Hoover SteamVac to our previous Bissell ProHeat 2x, one obvious benefit was the inclusion of two distinct tanks for clean and dirty water.  Having two tanks makes changing the water much easier.  The combined tank on the Bissell ProHeat was difficult to remove and was fairly large, which meant that dirty water sometimes dripped on the user.\\n\\nThe Hoover's cleaning brushes are powerful and do a really good job of churning up dirt and hair.  However, the user should use caution around delicate areas.  The device pulled up some looser fibers around a carpet seam in our living room.\\n\\nThe powered hand cleaning tool attachment works great, but securing the optional attachment is a pain.  The process involves reconfiguring the front panel of the dirty water tank and inserting the hose attachment, and then inserting the cleaning fluid attachment to a port on the front of the machine.  It works quite well once configured.\\n\\nWhile the unit employs two water tanks, the tanks are not very large.  Frequent trips to the sink are required to refill the water/empty dirty water if an individual is endeavoring to clean an entire house.  Our house is 1200 square feet but only about half of that is carpeted.  I estimate that four trips were made to empty and refill the water compartments.  In all fairness though, it had been about 2 months since we last cleaned the carpet and we do have four pets.\\n\\nFor all the back and forth to the sink, this machine produces results.  It picks up dirt very, very well.  It's not as fast and does not have as much capacity as a commercial unit, and compared to the Bissell ProHeat has a smaller sweeping width, but the Hoover leaves carpet very clean.  The unit also leaves carpets fairly dry after a couple of passes.\\n\\nOverall I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars. It seems to be a very good carpet cleaner for the money, but the construction seems rather flimsy in places and the process for affixing attachments should have been thought out more.</td>\n",

Our carpet was riddled with pet stains that didn't get cleaned well enough at the time. After a couple of runs with this little dynamo - they are gone! Naturally, newly soiled areas come up right away with this, but the real test for me was on the old stains, and I'm sold. It's not any larger than my vacuum so it's easy to store.

       "      <td>Disintegrated after 3.5 years: [Update: 05-22-2016]\\n\\nSo, this carpet cleaner lasted all of 3.5 years, with pretty light usage the last 2.5 years. A couple of months ago, it began leaking, and then the leaking got progressively worse. Last week, it began leaking so much that by the time I got to the carpet to clean, the water tank was half full. So, I took it apart, found the leaking part, which is a pathetically weak piece of plastic. Even the plastic clips would not stand up to opening them. But I glued the crap out of it, using waterproof glue, and hey, now it works. For now.\\n\\nHowever, the attachment no longer works, because it relies on a piece of plastic to pull another piece of plastic. The second piece of plastic got a little sticky, for some reason, and when I pulled back on the trigger, the first piece of plastic came apart. It isn't fixable. It's just a terrible piece of engineering--kinda like the first pathetically weak piece of plastic.\\n\\nWhile it lasted, this thing cleaned pretty well. But for our next carpet cleaner, I think we're going to try getting something that isn't built for the lifespan of a typical hamster.\\n\\nThe main things about this carpet cleaner are its light weight and improved suction over earlier models. I've been using a older Hoover model, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-F6215-900-SteamVac-Agility-Carpet-Cleaner/dp/B0002MR7A2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover F6215-900 SteamVac Agility Carpet Cleaner&lt;/a&gt;, which is about as agile as an elephant on ice. The FH50150PC weighs about seven pounds less, but it's also easier to push around because--I think--it holds less liquid than the earlier model. My overall impression is that Hoover put a little more design effort into the newer model, but it could still be better.\\n\\nThe carpet cleaning solution is probably the best indicator of cleaning ability; I've used Hoover's (expensive) solution for a while, and it works well, though it's made of pretty strong chemicals; it irritates my skin. But it has removed some really bad stains--cranberry juice, for example. I like that the solution goes into one tank and water into another, so I don't have to mix them, but the water tank is small (but again, lightweight, so easier to handle). Between the solution tank, the water tank, and the dirty-water tank, I was shutting the cleaner off and filling or emptying tanks quite often, but it's easy to do and, again, makes the cleaner light, so that's okay with me. I did often forget to move the switch from wash to rinse, though, which then meant that I had to go back over the same spots.\\n\\nHowever, while the solution could lift stains when used with the old Hoover, its poor suction meant that it just spread them out, unless I went over and over the carpet. Sometimes I would press down on the front of the cleaner with my foot to gain extra suction (picture the ergonomics of that). The new Hoover's suction is much better, and as a result, it removes dirty water much more efficiently. Even more importantly, because it sucks up water better, carpets are dry much sooner. With the old model, if I were planning a dinner party, I'd have to plan to clean the carpets early in the morning, run the house fan, open the windows, and make sure I cleaned the carpets in common areas first so that they would be dry before anyone showed up. With the new model, our carpets were dry in two hours.\\n\\nOur house has white carpet, and I have two young kids. So, even with strong solution and good suction, I still have to go over carpet multiple times, or else the carpet looks dingy. Actually, it still looks dingy, but it does look better than it did before cleaning. I think the point is that, for the price, this is probably the best you're going to get.\\n\\nThe included tools are nearly identical to the ones that shipped with the older Hoover; the spinning brush works okay, except that spraying solution from it is messy and inaccurate, and the brush is so bulky that it's difficult to get into crevices and small spaces, like auto interiors.\\n\\nThe cleaner is noisy (about the same as the older model). I wear hearing protection. The cord is unnecessarily short, so you can only do one room before having to unplug and replug.\\n\\nThe construction of the unit is okay; it doesn't seem as sturdy as the older model, but for the weight savings, I'm fine with that. The handle does not fold, though; that was a nice feature on the older model.\\n\\nI also find the array of Hoover models to be quite confusing. The price range is very narrow, and some units are priced identically. The weights vary; the inclusion of tools varies; every unit seems like a compromise.\\n\\nNevertheless, this model is an improvement over the older model, and makes me a little less reluctant to clean carpets.</td>\n",

I've tried many carpet cleaners &amp; non of them would suck up the water very well if at all. This Hoover steamvac works fabulous at cleaning pet stained carpets or heavily trafficked carpets. You'll know when the carpets are thoroughly cleaned. You can view the cleaner sucking up the dirt &amp; water through the transparent front top cover.\\n\\nIt may take you 3 or more cleanings to get it cleaned, depending on your carpets, however you can do it w/o worrying about any excess water remaining as it gets sucked up quickly. Impressive Indeed. This is where it gets ugly or fugly seeing what comes out of your carpets is very revealing &amp; perhaps embarrassing?\\n\\nUse boiling hot water with a large funnel when pouring into clean water tank. Just be careful &amp; use common sense. The clean hot boiling water works like magic for lifting up the dirt &amp; soap from carpet. Be careful with any sudsy cleaner you use, less is best.\\n\\nConsider adding your favorite essential oil (about 6-7 drops) to the clean water tank. I added pine. It works as a subtle deodorizer &amp; fragrance for your carpet. White vinegar added to the clean water tank the clean boiling water works great at deodorizing &amp; neutralizing cat or dog urine. Pine Sol may work too when added.\\n\\nThe powered hand tool with spinning brush worked beyond my expectations for cleaning upholstery, cat stands etc as good as the carpet cleaner does.\\n\\nNote: If &amp; when your Hoover SteamVac Spinscrub is not suctioning up the water from carpet or is blowing air then\\n\\nHere's how to quickly fix this issue: (copy &amp; pasted from elsewhere, so excuse the all CAPS)\\n\\nITS THE DUCT PIECE ON THE FRONT OF THE DIRTY WATER TANK (DWT). ITS NOT LINED UP.\\nNote: where you attach the upholstery tool next to &amp; adjust to use\\n\\n1. TAKE LID OFF OF DWT\\n\\n2. SLIDE THE LITTLE SQUARE PIECE (5'X5'X1) (THE DUCT) ON THE FRONT OF THE DWT AS FAR UP AS POSSIBLE AND IF IT BENDS FORWARD FROM THE TOP, DO THAT TOO (SOME MODELS OPEN LIKE A DOOR TOP DOWN, OTHERS JUST SLIDE UP AND OUT COMPLETELY)\\n\\n3. SLIDE THAT DUCT BACK DOWN AS FAR DOWN AND BACK AS IT WILL GO.\\n\\n4. PUT THE LID BACK ON BY HINGING THE FRONT LATCHES ON AND THEN SNAPPING THE BACK SIDE DOWN.\\n\\n5. CHECK TO SEE IF THAT DUCT PIECE ON THE FRONT IS LOOSE BY PUSHING ON IT AND SEEING IF IT MOVES UP AND DOWN.\\n\\nIF IT IS, THE LID ISNT COMPLETELY ON, GO BACK TO STEP 4.\\nIF THE DUCT IS SNUG, CONGRATS YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST MADE YOUR STEAM VAC **** UP THE WATER AGAIN\\n\\nNow the bad...\\n\\nRegarding the 1 star reviews the turbine within the Hoover SteamVac Spinscrub eventually fails, however this part is available thru amazon&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Turbine-Assembly-Gear-2-Left-Port-F5914-900-Fh50044/dp/B00Y33IU48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover Turbine, Assembly Gear 2 Left Port F5914-900 Fh50044&lt;/a&gt;\\n\\nWhich is Part Number 440007513 Turbine &amp; the gear assembly comes with an updated spin scrub block brush part number #44007359.\\n\\nRegardless of what machine you buy this part will eventually have to be replaced due to Hoover not using stainless steel screws internally. They'll eventually rust &amp; lock up. So make sure you empty out the water of both clean &amp; dirty water tanks out of after you're done to prolong the life, before storing.\\n\\nYes, I was really disappointed to hear this, but this is as good as it gets regarding a quality carpet cleaner, regardless how much you spend for any carpet cleaning machine. This machine lasted me 4 years before needing to replace the turbine, which anybody can easily replace.\\n\\nI hope this review helped you, please let me know if you appreciate this, by clicking on the yes button below.

Using this machine on hard floors without proper attachment may scratch or damage your floor.\"  This might be true for wood floors, but I've had no problems using it on my kitchen tile floor.  Even though I recently cleaned my floor with a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Scooba/dp/B000GB568O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Scooba&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(which also has a clean solution tank and a dirty solution tank), the SteamVac picked up dirty grey solution from my supposedly clean floor.\\n\\nWhile the manual recommends holding the trigger and pushing the cleaner forward then back to apply solution, then releasing the trigger and pushing forward and back once to vacuum the solution up, on the tile floor I discovered that it takes three forward/back passes to pick up most of the water on the tile surface, and another to get most of the water off the grout.  I'm going to guess that one forward/back motion will not be enough to get most of the water out of carpet.\\n\\nUpholstery: I tested the hand tools on well-used fabric-covered office chairs.  As I wrestled with the hand tools, I realized that this would be a job more easily done with a spray bottle, a scrub brush, and a wet/dry shop vac.  I used the hand tool with the brush to spray solution.  The solution sprays in a thin wide pattern.  This is great for large flat areas, like the back of the office chairs, but for narrow or curved areas I got overspray everywhere.  (On the bright side, I now know that the cleaning solution won't damage my carpet, other furniture, or clothing.)\\n\\nThe brush tool is large and awkward to fit into tight spaces.  The vacuum only tool is easier to get into the curved and tight areas in an office chair, but of course the whole 4-inch plus vacuum area has to be in contact with the upholstery or it won't pick up solution.  Both tools worked well on the back of the chair, which is pretty clean, but were difficult to use on places like the top edge of the chair, which gets handled all the time and is quite dirty.  A simple narrow pointed attachment (like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/this-one/dp/B006C2GATA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, WHICH DOES NOT FIT THIS VAC), would be perfect for rounded or tight places.  The hose also doesn't handle twisting well, and it takes some effort to twist the tool into position so it is flat on the surface.  It's no problem for me, but someone with arthritis or other hand or wrist problems might have trouble with it.\\n\\nI'll be testing this on carpet soon, and I'll update this review then.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A Frugal and Smart Choice: I got this product a little over two weeks ago and due to circumstances beyond my control, ended up not being able to use it until the day I was hosting a dinner party.  I was concerned about if the carpet would dry in time and almost didn't use it, but then one of my thoughtful cats decided to decorate the living room with his latest \"Hair Balls Tinged With Orange Cat Treats\" art piece.  I thanked my lucky stars that the cleaner came with a bottle of cleaner fluid because I was running against a clock and losing big time.  I shoved all of my furniture into my tiny kitchen to get it off the carpet and ran the vacuum a few times until the canister was coming back \"clean\".  Then after a quick trial &amp; error of operation, I got the Hoover to work (with no time for a spot test and hoping it wouldn't end up being my ultimate folly).\\n\\nThe first pass came back with filthy black water.  The orange spots didn't want to come out at first (I should have pre-treated them, but was in panic mode), but the Cleaning Surge mode scrubbed them right out.  I got curious and used the surge on some nacho cheese stains that my husband added to the carpet last year. I squealed like a kid at Christmas when I saw my bright beautiful white carpet show it's pretty face after a couple passes!!!  I then tackled the stains on the dining room carpet and our heavy traffic hallway.  I had to dump the water container 6 times and every time it came out black. I think I would have kept going &amp; let my guests show up/go hungry if I hadn't run out of cleaning liquid.  I can't tell you how happy I was for one night to have a house that looked &amp; smelled perfect!  (Yes, i &lt;3 the smell of the cleaning liquid.  It is fantastically floral!)  Alas, two outdoor cats who love to track in red clay, a husband that tends to miss the trashcan, and my own tendency to forget to take off my shoes at home means that within a week the carpet was back to its normal wear &amp; tear look.\\n\\nMy personal choice for buying this product was because of the other amazon reviews on it.  We decided to outright purchase a steam cleaner because renting one for 75$/day (+cleaner) seemed less frugal than just outright buying one for 140$ on sale.  It was simple to use, didn't leak, and best of all:  My carpet was COMPLETELY DRY within 20 minutes of using it. I had plenty of time to vacuum one more time and put all my furniture back without my dinner schedule being totally thrown off whack.\\n\\nLOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hoover SteamVac is the best!: The Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac is the best rug cleaner for the money!  Does the job as well as most professional rug cleaners but only for a lot less money. Being somewhat familiar with professional rug cleaners, I know the best cleaning system used by industrial professionals is the \"rotary-steam extraction method\", which employs one man with a rotary brush machine followed by a man with a steam vac (quite similar to the Hover SteamVac system).  Most domestic professionals use the \"steam extraction\" method, which does a fairly decent job. This method is used mainly because it is cost effective allowing only one man to do the job.\\nHoover came up with the technology that combines both the rotary and extraction method at the same time in one machine. A far superior system available to the public for around $150 bucks, quite remarkable!\\nSome ideas I have to improve your rug-cleaning job:\\n1. Use boiling water not hot tap water. The difference between 120 and 212 degrees is significant. The higher temperature disinfects as well as breaks down the dirt and grime without harming the machine.  The reason Hoover states hot tap water is liability.\\n2. The backstroke vacuums up the most water. So you can move the forward \"drying\" stroke a lot faster to get to the backstroke which extracts the most water. Make sure to use the backstroke very slowly.\\n3. Keep the machine as close to vertical as comfortable when in the drying backstroke to put more weight at the front of the machine where the suction actually takes place.\\n4. When the recovery tank is full you will hear a change in engine pitch and see the yellow ball at the top of the tank. Shut the machine off and wait until the ball drops and you can get a few more washing or drying strokes in before the tank is completely full.\\n5. Pretreat the real dirty spots with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/RESOLVE-CARPET-CLEANER-22-oz/dp/B000VPE89S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;RESOLVE CARPET CLEANER 22 oz.&lt;/a&gt;and then use the SteamVac to go over them first and if all else fails use the powered hand tool-a little more work, but definitely worth it.\\n6. It's best to move the machine to a tiled surface (kitchen or bath)-any water spilled is off the rug.\\n7. Change both tanks at the same time (empty lower and fill upper) and save yourself alot of extra trips to the sink.</td>\n",

While there's a lot that I like about the Hoover F5914-900 there's a lot NOT to like.  For starters it doesn't do as good a job on deep cleaning carpets as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BISSELL-ProHeat-Upright-Deep-Cleaner-25A3/dp/B001DEXA86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;BISSELL ProHeat Upright Deep Cleaner, 25A3&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and I frequently have to switch to the hand tool to clean bad spots.  That said the Hoover doesn't pull up so many carpet fibers and track them around.  Speaking of the wand attachment/hand I've never used a machine that had such a complicated, time-consuming means of attaching it for use.  It requires leaning the handle and Clean Water Tank back to access the Dirty Water Tank.  In the process water leaks out of the Clean Water Tank requiring a whole new clean up.  Attaching the hose requires opening the Dirty Water Tank (disgusting), sliding out a panel (which isn't easy, nor is getting it back in!), and then attaching the end of the hose to the tank and a separate water line.  Pretty simple eh?  Score one for Bissell where you simply turned a dial and powered it on.  Disconnecting the hose is similarly complicated and still more water leaks out (Yay!).  Suffice to say if you need this for quick cleanups you're better served by a smaller devise or simply leave the cleaning wand attached at all times.  That said, the rotating cleaning wand worked VERY well...the tradeoff is the general mess left behind.  The floor/carpet cleaning is decidedly so-so and my hunch is after using this for a while you'll still want to spring for one of the truly heavy duty cleaning machines or have a service come in and do it.\\n\\nAll in all, the Hoover F5914-900 is something of a disappointment as it does nothing particularly well.  If you need a knockabout general use machine I'm sure this is fine.  If you have pets or entertain frequently and need to clean up various spills this is NOT the machine for you.  Maybe I'm a bit extreme and simply need a machine that is specific for spot cleaning and treatment and another for general carpet clearning and that's probably where I'm headed.  But to my mind the Hoover F5914-900 is the Jack of all trades and the master of none.</td>\n",

It has done a good job of cleaning our carpets, which are kept dirty by three dogs. We reviewed the MaxExtract last year, and recently had a chance to compare those two against the PowerScrub. Here's how they compare.\\n\\nCLEANING PERFORMANCE:\\nA three-way tie. I used Hoover Premium Pet Formula Carpet/Upholstery Detergent in all three machines, according to the instructions for each (premix for the SteamVac, separate compartments for the other two). We cleaned separate sections of big spots with each machine. To our eyes, they were equally clean when wet, and also when dry. All three units are loud, like every other carpet cleaner.\\n\\nCLEANING CONVENIENCE:\\nThe PowerScrub and the MaxExtract have a very nice feature: You add the detergent to a separate compartment from the hot water. A switch enables you to spray mixed detergent solution, or plain water. One complaint we had after using the SteamVac for several years is that the sections of carpet with the worst stains would sometimes get dirty again fast. These deeply stained areas got a lot of detergent sprayed on them during cleaning, and we believe the stains might come back due to detergent buildup in the carpet. With the newer PowerScrub and MaxExtract models, you can switch to plain water and rinse these areas (or your whole carpet!)\\n\\nThe SteamVac has a Clean Surge feature that applies extra solution to stains and heavy traffic areas. I never found this to work any better than a just passing over the area again the normal way.\\n\\nHOW WET WERE THE CARPETS AFTER CLEANING:\\nThe carpets were noticeably dryer with this MaxExtract model. If you live in a colder area, or a humid area, this could be a deciding factor for you. The MaxExtract carpet fully dried in about half the time that the SteamVac carpet took. The PowerScrub carpets seemed slightly dryer than the SteamVac, but not as dry as the MaxExtract.\\n\\nHOW MUCH DETERGENT THEY USE:\\nAn unexpected outcome was that the PowerScrub and MaxExtract use significantly more detergent than the SteamVac-my guess is 50-100% more. Even using the maximum recommended amount of detergent in the SteamVac, it uses less.\\n\\nCLEAN WATER/DETERGENT TANK:\\nThe MaxExtract and PowerScrub hot water and detergent tank is easier to fill because pre-mixing is not necessary. This is not a huge deal, but the MaxExtract and PowerScrub are clearly newer machines with nice refinements in this area.\\n\\nDIRTY WATER TANK:\\nThe PowerScrub wins big points for its redesigned dirty water tank. It has a plug that you open to pour out the dirty water. This is MUCH easier than the MaxExtract or the SteamVac, both of which require you to take off the lid to pour out the water. With the PowerScrub, you use the spout to pour out dirty water, then only take of the lid once at the end of the day to rinse the tank and sponge filter. When you clean a lot of carpets, this kind of refinement matters.\\n\\nUPHOLSTERY CLEANING:\\nThe SteamVac and the PowerScrub include a SpinScrub hand tool with a spinning brush. We found this tool to be nearly useless. It seems like a lot of the suction power that comes down the hose is used just to spin the brush, so there is less suction left to suck out the dirty water. We found the simple Carpet and Upholstery Tool included with all three machines worked much better.\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nSteamVac: Costs less to buy and use, but this is an older machine that does not have the refinements of the other two. Leaves carpets wetter, and may leave more detergent in the carpet unless you empty the detergent tank and fill it with water only.\\nMaxExtract: As its name suggests, leaves carpets drier than the other machines. Allows you to rinse with water.\\nPowerScrub: Easiest emptying of the dirty water tank, which is very nice. Allows you to rinse with water.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\nIf you are cost conscious, buy the SteamVac. If you want the easiest experience, buy the PowerScrub. If you want dryer carpets quicker, buy the MaxExtract. You will get clean carpets with all three machines.\\n\\n2016 UPDATES:\\nFirst, the Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Washer,  FH50150 has been updated since we bought it about 10 years ago. The photos show a model that is very similar looking to ours, but with somewhat different details. The key points APPEAR to be the same, but I cannot tell because we have the old model, not the new one.\\n\\nSecond, I definitely prefer models with the RINSE feature at this point. This allows you to remove more detergent from your carpet by running across each section with plain water after washing.\\n\\nThird, the chart supplied by hoover is WRONG on one detail: The MaxExtract 77 model clearly has a RINSE/WASH knob in the photos, but does not show a RINSE feature in the chart. The knob is grey, below the red round Hoover logo in the photos.\\n\\nFinally, at this time (last week of December 2015) the price for the MaxExtract is just twenty more than the price of the other two (prices may change). At that price, I would recommend the MaxExtract 60 over the other two models.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Don't get a puppy without it!: I've never had a carpet shampooer before, so I can't compare it to others out there. I can only give you my personal experience with this one. My husband assembled this for me, and says it was very simple to do. The manual wasn't very clear to me on how to use or assemble the attachments. Even so, I probably could have at least used the main part without consulting the manual.\\n\\nIf your carpets are older and/or have never been cleaned, you're in for a real treat here. Not only will you SEE how much disgusting gunk has been lurking in your carpet, you'll SMELL it when you empty the container. This is something you'll want to take outside and clean out with your garden hose each time you use it. Clean the brushes, the attachment and the tank every time. Trust me, you don't want that stuff sitting around waiting to be spilled or smelled, especially if you're using this to clean up pet accidents.\\n\\nFor a general carpet cleaning, you'll want to vacuum first to get up particles and dust. Otherwise you just end up with hair and chunks caught in the brushes and in the front part where the cleaning solution gets sucked back in. That front area traps quite a bit of pet hair (German shepherd in my case), and you need to keep it clear to get the full benefit. The unit comes with this long flat black rubbery squiggly thing for the express purpose of cleaning that slot. If you lose it like I did, one of those Draino snakes will do the trick.\\n\\nFill the clean water tank with cleaning solution and water according to the instructions. I've seen some other recipes for cleaning, including use of boiling water and other cleaning chemicals. I have no idea how this might affect the shampooer, its efficacy or safety. I've tried pre-soaking and doing a post-cleaning \"rinse\" by sprinkling on plain water, but that's the only deviation from instructions I've done.\\n\\nAnyway, get it all together, turn it on and start cleaning. Press a button on the handle to release water/cleaning solution as you go forward, and release it as you go backward to let the brushes and suction remove the liquid and dirt. It's tempting to go fast like you would with a vacuum, but you'll want to slow down and take your time with it. The slower you go, the more solution gets in and the more time it has to penetrate. As you go back slowly, the brushes have more time to loosen dirt, and more liquid is removed, making drying time shorter.\\n\\nOne feature I love is the two separate tanks--one for clean water, and one for dirty water. You never spray dirty water back onto your carpet with this machine. The tanks are very easy to remove for emptying and filling, too. They just snap back into place--no confusing dials to tighten or worrying you didn't get it on right, possibly causing a leak. There's also no confusion about which tank goes where.\\n\\nThe suction power on this thing is outstanding. I thought I would be stepping in wet spots for days after a cleaning, but it's completely dry within a few hours. This varies with how much liquid was on the carpet in the first place, but even a soaked spot is dry within a day. The scrubbing brushes loosen the dirt and help get even more gunk out. I use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Platinum-Collection-Pet-Plus-Carpet-and-Upholstery-Detergent-50-Ounces-AH30035/dp/B001U3WKFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover Platinum Collection Pet Plus Carpet-and-Upholstery Detergent, 50 Ounces, AH30035&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with this, and it has completely removed fresh stains every single time. My success with older stains has varied with type and age. If it doesn't remove an older stain, it usually makes it fade.\\n\\nI was afraid with a new puppy that I was going to have a smelly house, and there wouldn't be anything I could do about it. My husband thinks the house actually smells better since we got the dog because I am constantly cleaning the carpets and spot cleaning the furniture. The ultimate test was my mother, who could not smell ANYTHING when she came for a visit. If my mom can't smell anything after using this carpet cleaner, you won't either. This is a worthwhile investment with or without pets, for a cleaner, healthier, better-smelling house.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Four and a half stars: The FH50150 has been such a godsend. I don't know why I kept renting carpet shampooers from my local grocery store all these years, especially when we have an apartment above the garage and we can amortize the expense. It's true, what other reviewers say, that the plastic feels flimsy, but I feel confident after using it on six different rooms and a set of very dirty stairs that it's not going to break unless I do something stupid. It's also true that the holding tank is small. (This became less annoying after a marathon 8-hour carpet cleaning day when my arm began to get tired.) For these two reasons I would have given it four and a half stars had that been an option. I rounded up to five stars because it's done an amazing job getting my carpets and stairs clean. I particularly like the ability to switch back and forth between the rinse and wash settings.\\n\\nI tried it first on our back door entryway with just plain hot water, and there was black sludge -- literally -- in the used water tank. I had read in other reviews that wetting the carpet first with plain water made the clean cycle more effective, and I did an experiment to see how much dirt I could get out of the carpet with just water. I used three tanks' worth of hot water on a 9'x12' FLOR rug (which is not supposed to be shampooed, but I ignore that) before turning it to wash. Then I did just one wash pass and switched back to rinse. I've been using this method with all my carpets and it works really well, and saves on cleaning fluid. I ordered&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-CLEANPLUS-2X-64oz-Carpet-Cleaner-and-Deodorizer-AH30330/dp/B005CWK0FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover CLEANPLUS 2X 64oz Carpet Cleaner and Deodorizer, AH30330&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;from Amazon and got Hoover's Deep Cleansing Spot and Stain Remover ($5.97 as an add-on) -- I'm glad I did because the stain remover spray got out some stains that the shampooer couldn't. In some rooms I saw foam on the rinse setting, which I think was residual shampoo left from previous cleanings. The cleaning solution has a strong but pleasant odor which disappears when the carpet dries.\\n\\nThe FH50150 is loud -- I wore ear protection. The stair tool worked well although I did find that if I got too artistic while spraying, the water cut off. The instructions say to keep the nozzle low. I used the SpinScrub Powered Hand Tool on landings. The crevice tool was handy for the edges of wall to wall carpeting, especially around doors. (While the upright gets fairly close to walls, it does leave a 1/4\" along the wall uncleaned.) Sometimes the tank-full cutoff activated before the tank was full; I could override that by restarting the machine. Note: it is described as an \"automatic shut-off\" but it doesn't actually shut off -- the suction stops, which you can hear as a higher pitched whine. I tried the upholstery tool on a rounded seat cushion and was a little alarmed at how wet it got, but it dried out within a day. The leaking others report only occurred for me when I was working on area rugs, and the instructions said to bring a towel to sit it on, good advice. (The instructions, in fact, are full of don't-do-this! and don't-do-that! but it was much, much easier to assemble and use than the instructions made it seem.) I'm looking forward to tackling upholstery next -- if I encounter any problems I'll update this review.</td>\n",

I am a mother of two toddlers and have no pets. I have most recently used the Electrolux Ergorapido cordless stick vacuum, which is ok on hard floors but terrible on carpets and can't pick up anything the size of a cheerio. I also own a rainbow, as my main (once a week vacuum), which is fabulous and powerful but big, bulky and corded. Since I have purchaced the Hoover Linx, I have not touched my rainbow. The Hoover works amazingly well on my carpets and on my hard floors. The power of this cordless vaccum is shocking, and it cleans right up to the very edge of the wood work. It is a bit difficult to manuver on stairs, but still much easier then dealing with a cord and heavy vaccum. I do wish it had attachments to clean under couch cushions, etc. but I still can't give this one any less then 5 stars. I can vaccum my entire 1800sf house and still have battery life left. I had been eyeing this vacuum for quite a while, but did not buy it right away because I thought it was pricey for a stick vaccum. I was so wrong.

Was definitely soiled heavily by dogs from the previous owner. I used this with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Platinum-Collection-Pet-Plus-Carpet-and-Upholstery-Detergent-50-Ounces-AH30035/dp/B001U3WKFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover Platinum Collection Pet Plus Carpet-and-Upholstery Detergent, 50 Ounces, AH30035&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ryter-Odormute-Pet-Odor-Eliminator-Concentrate-Unscented/dp/B0002D3250/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Ryter Odormute Pet Odor Eliminator Concentrate (Unscented)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to thoroughly clean. The first time through the entire house I had to make 4 passes over each area, twice with the \"surge\" button depressed. This literally got out every single stain throughout the whole house, and got rid of the smell completely! Our hideous carpet now looks cleaner then most peoples newer carpet!\\n\\nI had a 10 year old steamvac previously that had lost its suction, and this replaced it nicely. To do general cleaning you just need to do one forward clean stroke and one suction back stroke. The surge button works good for any real stains or soiled areas. The hose and attachment works decently for stairs, no where near as well as the actual base unit though. The top solution container and bottom waste container are easy to remove/refill/clean, however I wish they were a bit larger. I can easily go through 10+ containers just to do our den (since we're septic I dump the waste container outside far away from the house too - so it's a pain). Also make sure you keep the brushes clean underneath, so they can scrub the carpet well.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this unit compare to our last is how well it dries. If you need the area dried quickly - just make an additional sucking pass - and usually the floor is virtually completely dry within the hour! It works well enough that you can walk around with socks on immediately afterwards and not get extremely damp feet. Our old steamvac model didn't dry nearly as well, it was several hours after cleaning until it was completely dry.</td>\n",

Allows you to rinse with water.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\nIf you are cost conscious, buy the SteamVac. If you want the easiest experience, buy the PowerScrub. If you want dryer carpets quicker, buy the MaxExtract. You will get clean carpets with all three machines.\\n\\n***********************************************************\\nBelow is the review that I wrote in 2008 for the SteamVac:\\n\\nI read the reviews, and bought this model two weeks ago (August 2008). I've run 20 tanks of detergent through this machine cleaning rugs and carpets. Rather than repeat what you've read already, here's an update:\\n\\nThe \"Snap\": The clean water tank handle snaps into the machine to hold the tank in place. Mine never leaks.\\n\\nBoiling Water: Works great. I initially filled half the tank with boiling water. That worked well, so I dragged out the stew pot to fill the whole tank with boiling water. This worked even better: the waste water is even darker  brown as a result. It also seems that the waste water comes out of the carpet faster when you do this (fewer sucking laps). Boiling water is a winner.\\n\\nLeaks: Can't get this thing to leak. The tanks must have been redesigned.\\n\\nExtra laps to dry the carpet: This works. I noticed that a third drying lap sucked out more water (one lap with trigger depressed, then two laps just sucking). However, when using boiling water (see above), you want to keep the water as hot as possible. So go 1 lap with the trigger depressed, then 1 lap without, then move on. Come back later to suck out more water.\\n\\nDetergent and Pre-Treatment: The Hoover Deep Cleansing detergent that came with this machine worked well in conjunction with an enzyme-based pet spot remover. I ordered a gallon of the Hoover Premium Pet Formula, which works very well.\\n\\nTank Sizes: If you follow the instructions (one lap with trigger down, one lap without), the detergent tank will empty about when the waste tank is full. If you do extra laps to dry the carpet further, the waste tank will fill before the detergent tank is empty. Spraying a lot of pretreatment on your carpet will also result in the waste tank filling faster. This is a minor design flaw-the waste tank should have been bigger.\\n\\nCleaning the Waste Tank: I didn't understand why so many people complained about the difficulty of cleaning the waste tank. Hold it in your left hand. Spray water into it from your kitchen sink sprayer with your right hand. Twist your hands a little to get into the nooks and crannies. You'll be done in 60 seconds.</td>\n",

They are SPILL PICKUP (left), GENTLE BRUSH (center) and POWER BRUSH (right).\\nWhen I started clean the carpet, I pushed the button to the center (gentle brush), before I turned on the power, the button stayed right in place.\\nWhen I ran it over the carpet just for few seconds, the button slided itself to the left (power brush).\\n\\nThen, I clean the dirty bucket and went ahead to dry the carpet. So, I pushed the button again to the right (SPILL PICKUP), the button slided again to the far right (power brush) when I ran it over to dry the carpet for few seconds.\\nOhhh....that made me felt very frustrated.\\nMaybe I didn't have luck to get a good working unit.\\n\\nAnother experience, I attached the hose to clean a spot, ohh....it wasn't an easy step, and took me so long to attach and detach the hose.\\nI do love Hoover vacuum, and that works great and picks up lots of dirt. I think I will still look around for a better model from Hoover selection to pick up another steamVac.</td>\n",

I purchased it to use in between my regular vacuuming to keep up with dog hair and the many crumbs that come with having small kids, It does such a good job that I found that I don't need to get out my large vacuum more than once a week AND I am done so much quicker since I don't have to take time to move a cord around to different outlets. It has a switch position for hard floor and carpet and the carpet mode has just enough suction to get everything up, but it isn't so strong it gets tangled in my rugs. It also fits under my end tables and kitchen cabinets very nicely and it has definitely far exceeded my expectations with its long lasting battery and excellent suction. All of this for under $100! I highly recommend this vacuum for small and large homes alike. It's awesome!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wonderful clean carpets: I have two dogs, two cats (one of them throws up frequently) and a spouse who always forgets to take off his shoes when coming home. In addition we have \"fabulous\" orange clay in the backyard and our dogs think that digging in it is the greatest thing in the world. Even though we try to wipe their paws when they come in, there is always some orange left. Since my spouse and I are very busy we did not get to cleaning our carpets for two years.

I am so happy that we finally purchased a carpet cleaner.\\nI did have to fill and empty the water tanks quite frequently but that was manageable. The carpet dried really fast. I went over the wet carpet a lot and left the windows open. I do not think that the machine is heavy. I can't say anything about the longevity since we only used it for three rooms. I have never cleaned carpets in my life, therefore I can't compare this machine to any other. I really hope that this machine does not break early because I am so happy with it. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good value.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Factory Re-furb Owner Review and Recipe: **EDITED due to new information**\\n\\nI'm very annoyed with my unit and kind of with Hoover in general.\\n\\nI wanted to purchase this unit brand new with the full warranty, etc. But my husband bought the factory refurbished one instead with a one year warranty. When he contacted the seller, he was told that really the unit was just an open box unit which had been used only once and returned, and the factory refurbished it like new. It was a little over $50.\\n\\nSo the problem started when we received the unit and the inside looked a little dirty. I immediately wanted to return it, but my husband didn't want to go to the trouble and he decided we should try it out. We have a three year old and our rental apartment is fully carpeted throughout, and we were both tired of our ugly carpet. We'd been spending $45 to rent steam cleaners from grocery stores about once every few months.\\n\\nSo I gave in.\\n\\nWe probably used it twice before the middle brush completely broke off. We were not in any way rough on the unit or irresponsible with it. I was cleaning with it and started hearing a weird noise underneath. I lifted the unit to inspect, and the middle brush fell right out without me even touching it. The stem had completely broken off. None of the brushes will turn now, I guess it needs all the brushes in place in order to turn? So to use the vacuum we have to use the hand attachments. Imagine cleaning the carpeting in a 1500 square foot apartment with only the hand attachments. A few more weeks of this and I'll have shoulders like a body builder.\\n\\nIt's too late to return with the warranty, since it took me a year to convince my husband that the brushes on the unit will not turn. So now I'm going to try buying a set of replacement brushes. We'll see how that goes. I will update my review after that. If that doesn't help I will have to take it to a vacuum cleaner repair shop. With all the money I'm going to have to spend, it would have been less expensive to just buy the thing brand new.\\n\\nAll that aside, it does clean well. Even just using the hand attachments. The first time we used it our carpet looked great. Almost as good as when we'd first moved in and the carpet had just been professionally cleaned. It dried much faster than the steam cleaners we had rented, but it didn't clean quite as deeply. The nap on our carpet did go back to looking new though, which does not happen with the hand attachments no matter how hard I scrub. Long story short, this thing cleans way better than just using a scrub brush and elbow grease, but not nearly as good as a professional cleaner. Ideally, one could keep their carpets clean with a weekly once-over. If one just so happened to have a working unit.\\n\\nI've used this on my couch and dining room chair upholstery and it works just fine. I've only used it with the Hoover Platinum cleaner and it did no damage to my upholstery. Not sure if I would try any other cleaners in case it bleached out the fabric.\\n\\nThanks to Pinterest, I found a recipe for a cleaner that works great with this unit, and is less expensive and works 10 times better than Hoover Platinum. Here's the recipe for anyone brave enough to try it. I suggest trying it on a small spot of your carpet just in case it bleaches it out or something. I had nothing to lose thanks to a paint mess my daughter made, so I tried it on my beige carpet and it worked perfectly.\\n\\n** Carpet Cleaner Recipe **\\n\\n2 tablespoons ammonia (or you can use windex if you aren't afraid of the blue dye)\\n1 teaspoon dish soap (i prefer dawn)\\n2 cups of rubbing alcohol\\na few drops of essential oil (for scent purposes. this is optional)\\n\\nMix together, add to tank, add HOT HOT HOT water on top.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nAnother recipe I use which is pretty much a miracle (I keep it in a spray bottle for a quick spot cleaning) is this:\\n\\n** Miracle Carpet Cleaner **\\n\\n1/2 cup ammonia\\n1/2 cup white distilled vinegar\\n1/2 cup mrs. meyers all purpose solution (i use the basil scent. it covers the awful ammonia smell)\\n3-4 tablespoons of dish soap\\n2 cups rubbing alcohol\\n\\nHopefully this is useful to someone!\\n\\n***\\n\\nNew information. You can purchase single replacement brushes and a full set of replacement brushes on here. Unfortunately after reading the reviews on those replacement brushes and after having had the experience I have had so far with my vacuum, I have to strongly recommend against buying this vacuum if you can help it. Next time I will try a different brand. I have had Hoover vacs in the past which I didn't like, so I'm not really surprised.\\n\\nHere's the set of replacement brushes&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-SteamVac-Brush-Block-5-Brushes-Part-48437022/dp/B001ICM7J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover SteamVac Brush Block - 5 Brushes Part # 48437022&lt;/a&gt;\\n\\nHere's the single replacement brush&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Steam-Cleaner-Drive-Scrub-Brush-42-3800-57/dp/B008MKHDX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Hoover Steam Cleaner Drive Scrub Brush 42-3800-57&lt;/a&gt;\\n\\nI'm going to get the full set of replacement brushes, and if they fail again I'm just going to get rid of this whole thing and start over with a new brand of machine altogether. I don't want to spend more money than I would have buying it brand new only to have it keep on failing.</td>\n",

SUPER Easy to assemble, only requires you to screw in 2 screws (included) and push some thing in here and there.\\n2. Very easy to detach both the water tank and the dirty water tank.\\n3.

Didn't pick up all the hair in the carpeting, but left some clumps on the surface that should be a cinch to suck up with the vacuum.\\n2. Dirty water tank is small, it filled twice on a 15x11 room (with furniture in place so I'd say about half that size).\\n3. Solution goes fast, I filled it twice (however only used about 1.5 of it).\\n4. Water tank is small I filled it twice (three times actually but I went over the carpet with hot water first without solution to prime the carpet).\\n\\nIncluding a video of the dirty water tank dumping.</td>\n",

Better than the MaxExtract: Got this one for my neighbor who is constantly using mine.  This unit is great on carpets, better than the newer and more expensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-MaxExtract-All-Terrain-Carpet-Cleaner-F7452900/dp/B000FFM00S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover MaxExtract All-Terrain Carpet Cleaner, F7452900</a>&nbsp;I also have, which is better on tile floors and for any hand held unit stuff.\\n\\nWith 4 kids and 2 dogs. Can't live without one of these. I ended up getting a 2nd one when the other was in the shop getting repaired.\\n\\nCord is shorter on this unit and the hand attachments aren't as good as than the newer one.   \n",

We always rented a Rug Doctor and it was becoming quite a hassle to pick it up and return it. Lifting it in and out of our car's trunk was another hassle we wanted to do away with.  I purchased the Hoover F5914-900 after reading the reviews. It was easy to assemble.\\n\\nThis steam cleaner is much smaller & lighter than the Rug Doctor we are used to using, making it easier to push & maneuver around. However, because of the smaller size, we  emptied and filled the upper and lower tanks, eight times while cleaning our 12'x 26' carpet. The clean solution tank holds one gallon of water (one reason for the light weight). The instructions say to fill it with hot tap water and the detergent which is easily measured using the tank's cap as a measuring cup.  The unit itself cleans about a 11-11.5\" wide area and doesn't clean close enough to the woodwork to suit me. So, I used the stair/upholstery nozzle to clean next to the woodwork and other tight areas. That tool did a good job for us. Hooking it up was a bit confusing and my hubby was worried that he was going to break the clear, recovery tank front panel. It pulls down a little hard, just don't force it. There is also a powered hand tool that has rotating brushes included with this steam vac.  I didn't feel the need to try out this unit's Clean Surge feature because I had already pre-treated the bad areas.\\n\\nVacuum your carpeting before steam cleaning otherwise you'll end up clogging the steam cleaner. I pretreated the heavy traffic areas with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bissell-0801-Oxy-Gen2-Booster/dp/B000RH0JGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bissell 0801 Oxy Gen2 Booster</a>&nbsp;which I applied liberally to the carpet and waited 10 minutes before steam cleaning.  For stubborn areas, I pre-treat, steam clean, let dry, pre-treat again, steam clean, let dry, then rinse. For normal cleaning, I pre-treat, steam clean, let dry, then rinse.  I'm happy with the results. The heavy traffic areas are now the same color as the rest of my carpet. This time I around I used&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-40321128-Deep-Cleansing-Carpet-Upholstery-Detergent-128-Ounce/dp/B0002B8LIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover 40321128 Deep Cleansing Carpet/Upholstery Detergent, 128-Ounce</a>. I might try another brand of steam cleaning detergent next time.\\n\\nTake good care of your steam cleaner. Be sure to read the instruction booklet & be sure to follow the storage instructions when you put it away after cleaning your carpet.\\n\\nSo far so good; we are both pleased with our Hoover SteamVac. Because of the steam vac's light weight, we are not exhausted after cleaning our carpets.  The Hoover did a good job of picking up the water, but it took our carpet more than 2 hours to dry.   \n",

SO easy to put together.: <div id=\"video-block-R2QK4DAI60IPAP\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/F14k3pzCGVS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DbF%2BPZqTS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">I purchased this Hoover Power Scrub Carpet Cleaner on Amazon a couple of weeks ago (I THINK) as an Amazon Deal of the Day item. I have been wanting a steam cleaner for years now but just never broke down and purchased one. So when I saw this one go on sale, and it had good reviews, I said to myself Well why not?! and purchased it haha.\\n\\nI am very glad I did. I feel like it was a pretty good buy and it was super easy to put together. It sat in its box in our laundry room for a week and a half or so before I decided to put it together. I procrastinated putting it together because I figured there would be a lot of parts and it would take me awhile. This is the first steam cleaner I have ever owned so I just wasn't sure how much of my time it would take up to assemble it. It went together in less than 5 minutes  it was that easy! Now I feel silly for waiting to get it out of the box haha.\\n\\nI have used this machine three times so far. The first time I tested it on one black stain on our floor that had popped up just a few days prior. It was already pretty late at night when I put it together but I wanted to see how well it worked on a stain and also make sure it wasn't going to mess the carpet up etc.\\n\\nI wish I would have taken a before and after photo of the stain it pulled out of the carpet to show you a comparison because it was literally one of the only stains we had on our carpet. We just got our new home a year and a half ago and we don't let our children run around the house with food, we always take our shoes off at the door etc. So our carpet was already in pretty decent shape as far as stains go.\\n\\nAnyway, I was pleasantly surprised the first time I tested it out. The stain came out with ease and I decided that the next morning I was going to do our childrens rooms.\\n\\nThis steam cleaner comes with 16 ounces of starter solution that smells so nice and clean when you are done too. I also love how it comes with extra cleaning tools in a mesh bag with a hook on the top that way you can hang it up when not in use. It comes with the following tools:\\n\\n-SpinScrub Powered Hand Tool\\n-Stair Tool\\n-Upholstery Tool\\n-Crevice Tool\\n-16 oz. Solution\\n-Mesh Tool Storage Bag\\n\\nLike I said, we don't really have much on the floor as far as stains go, but check out the water I dumped after doing our sons room. It definitely pulled out a lot of dirt and other things from the carpet:\\n\\nBy this point, I was getting super excited about this Hoover Carpet Cleaner. I texted my husband about it and said, \"How sad is it that I am so excited about this LOL?!\" Ahhhhh Adulting. Funsies.\\n\\nThen I did our toddler girls room as well as our bedroom that day. The next day I decided to tackle our living room. We spend most of our time in there when we are home so naturally the water was definitely dirtier.\\n\\nAs I was cleaning our living room, I started to find these nasty clumps of hair/dirt/who knows what else on the floor. I assume it is just gunk and hair that was tangled up in the scrubbing brushes, but yeah, gross! I have included pics of them.\\n\\nOverall, I love this steam cleaner and I am very satisfied with it so far. The 16 oz of solution only did two rooms (two kids rooms and I barely finished) so I did end up having my husband bring home some more solution from the store.   \n",

weekend.  I read a few reviews from people who received used machines.  When I unpacked the unit, it seemed to have more scratches than one would expect with a new machine.  However, the main reason I think mine might be used is because the measuring cup, and in particular the black ring that surrounds it, are covered in a white powdery substance that MAY be dried detergent.  Also, the underside of the lid of the water tank has a bit of a brown, sticky-looking substance.  I've included a short clip of the measuring cup.  Before I go through the hassle of returning this, can anyone who purchased this machine tell me if their cup had this white substance on it?   \n",

I'm getting used to this, and it's easier if I use my stronger hand for the machine and weaker hand for the handle.\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\\nHoover Platinum CSV is absolutely shines in two areas: ease of use (switching from brushroll on to brushroll off, going between surface heights & types), and cleaning ability, especially the tricky maneuver of getting pet hair off area rugs.\\n\\nWORD TO THE WISE:\\nI got this information from Hoover after my battery failed: don't store the battery in the charger. (I stored it in the charger and only took it out of the charger when I used it.)  There is nothing in the instructions about this, but storing it in the charger can cause it to fail. It's OK to leave it several hours or overnight, but then take it out of the charger and put it in the vacuum.  The battery will continue to hold the full charge no matter how long it is stored in the vacuum. (Thanks to the 2 year warranty on the battery, they are sending me a new one at no charge.)\\n\\nRead on if you are interested in more detailed comments:\\n\\nPrice:\\nI am sure that with time the price will come down or discounts will be available from the $179 list.  I know that the Hoover Platinum Lightweight Bagged Upright (another model in this line) which originally listed for $399 is readily available online for $300 now.  (Nov 12, 2009 edit: Price has finally dropped into the $150 range!)\\n\\nBattery Life:\\nThe battery life is quite good, and I like the \"fade-free\" aspect of the product - it works at full power for the whole time.  It does a much better job so much quicker than my old vac and I am more than satisfied, since I can get everything I want done in a single charge.\\n\\nBagless feature:\\nI think I finally understand why bagless vacuums are so popular, even though they are more work: there is something so satisfying about SEEING how much dirt and pet hair you have removed from your flooring. But however satisfying it is to see what you have removed, it creates an extra step that you need to perform nearly every time you use a bagless vac - ANY bagless vac - if you want it to maintain its cleaning power.  With my previous stick vac, the dust cup emptied fine, but I had to pull the dust off the filter with my fingers to ready it for the next use, and occasionally use another vacuum to clean the filter because it was not washable.  The Hoover Platinum CSV, however, is exceptionally easy to empty and clean. The dust cup empties from the bottom, the baffle tube is easy to remove from the dust cup assembly if necessary (which it will be, if you have multiple long-haired daughters), and the filter can be bushed off with a dry toothbrush and washed when necessary. Long hair does tend to wind around the baffle tube (part of the bagless system).  Fortunately, that is easy to remove when emptying the dust cup.\\n\\nCarpet Cleaning:\\nI have used (and liked, and still believe it is a good stick vac, although with limitations) the Eureka The Boss Lite Cordless (96 b)<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Eureka-96-B-Quick-Up-Upright-Cordless-Stick-Vacuum/dp/B00004VWIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Eureka 96 B Quick Up Upright Cordless Stick Vacuum</a>&nbsp;cordless (rated 4  stars on Amazon) for years on my hardwood floors and area rugs for quick cleanups, so I have a basis for comparison.\\n\\nMy old Boss Lite was great on bare floors, but only better-than-nothing on rugs. (I used to kneel down and wipe the surface with a well-wrung out sponge to get the hair off my area rugs because the brush-roll on the Eureka just wasn't up to it.)  By comparison, the Hoover Platinum Cordless Stick Vac is amazingly good at getting surface pet hair, dirt, and sock lint off rugs.  It won't deep clean, but it will help to make the carpet surface LOOK clean, which is all I want for a quick clean up.\\n\\nEase of use:\\nEasily goes from one surface to another seamlessly, except for certain very lightweight mats.  Rubber backed bathmats and doormats require me to lift the vacuum up off the bare floor and onto the rug, but it does a good job on those at cleaning them rather than sucking them up. It cannot be used on the very lightest towel-weight throw rugs with no backing, even without the brushroll - it sucks them up. With ordinary area rugs, however, the Hoover Platinum CSV goes up and over the edge with amazing ease.\\n\\nEdge cleaning:\\nThis vacuum has excellent edge cleaning.  I don't ever have to stoop down to get that random bit of whatever from near the baseboard.  This is a MAJOR plus when compared to my old stick vac.\\n\\nClearance:\\nThe Hoover Platinum CSV will go under about the first 9 inches of furniture with only about 2  inches of clearance,- you can't go further than that, because the bagless dust cup gets in the way.  But if you have more clearance - about 8 inches (what my kitchen chairs have under the crossbars between the legs)- then you can get completely under.\\n\\nWas there anything I liked BETTER about the my old stick vac?\\nYes, I liked the way it hung on the wall to charge. The Hoover has a charging base which charges the battery, and the vac, while it stands on its own (a plus), does require floor space.   \n",

timely manner and re-packaged well After opening ..handle assembly was missing the screws Amazon refunded $10.00 for the hassle and i went to my local hardware store and picked them up for $5.00 no big deal there, second issue The surge spray is broken inside the handle unfixable but i do not need this option\\n\\nI gave this a 4  star even though the parts were missing and the surge spray dose not work because the normal spray works great i see no need to put extra spray on the carpet.\\nMany had leaking issues but i had none\\n\\nPerformance: Great machine for what you pay I spent 1 hour

That was on Friday afternoon, on the bedroom rug, which was a lot filthier than I could've imagined. We have two dogs. One is very old and prone to accidents, the other is just stubborn and likes to pee on the spots where I thought I'd cleaned up the accidents. I've used a Bissel Spot cleaner every time one of the pups misbehaves on the rug, but when I saw this on sale I had to try it.\\n\\nI spent about two hours working on the bedroom carpet. I watched as the muck and grime of fecal filth and city soot shot up through suction tube and into the waste tank, it was so gratifying that I didn't care about the blisters forming on my right hand. The carpet was so much filthier than I could've imagined. The proof was right there in the tank. I cleaned the entire thing five times, refilled the hot water and detergent tanks ten times, and emptied the dirty water container three times. It was fantastic!\\n\\nMy problem started when I tried cleaning the hallway rug and the suction stopped working. I checked all the lids and latches. Everything seemed to be exactly as it was when I was attacking the bedroom rug, but no suction, no waves of muck pouring into the waste tank. All I had was a very wet and kinda stinky front hallway rug, blisters on my right hand from pushing and pulling the machine for so many hours, and a horrible headache from listening to the hold music on the 800 number for Hoover customer service. I had attempted to call them twice; the first time I was on hold for 15 minutes before I gave up, the second time I lasted 27 minutes listening to the same crappy Mozart recording.\\n\\nMy service representative patiently walked me through all the steps I'd already taken on my own, then finally concluded that the machine needed to go to the repair shop. I live in Manhattan, every authorized repair shop is on the Bronx or Queens. This machine is bulky and weighs at least 60 lbs, at least it feels like it does. It's like an overgrown R2D2 with a handle and removable tanks. Cab fare to the Bronx or Queens would cost more than the machine, and there's no way I could schlepp it over to the subway station and down all those steps to wait on a crowded platform then ride on a crowded train only to have to walk it through streets in a neighborhood far, far away. I told her I'd rather throw it away. I almost started to cry. My hands were sore and stiff and my front carpet was sopping wet. And my husband had thrown out the box so I couldn't return it to Amazon.\\n\\nBut then Sheila, my wonderful TTI Floor Care service rep, spoke to her supervisor. I didn't hear that conversation, but she managed to get authorization to send me a brand new unit. She told me to cut the cord and email her a picture.\\n\\nCutting the cord felt cruel, like an execution. I couldn't do it. So I waited until I was less emotional, which rarely happens. The next morning the machine was still plugged into the outlet in my hallway. I wheeled it into my kitchen, where the rug is thinner and would dry faster if my final attempt to run the machine on a small un-trafficked corner of the carpet failed. I flipped on the power switch and hit the solution release trigger. Right away I got that ultra-satisfying whoosh of dirty water gushing into the waste tank (see video below). It was beautiful. I moved all the furniture off the kitchen carpet and shampooed all of it. I emptied the waste tank, refilled the water tank and went over it again. And then the suction stopped working and I had a sopping wet kitchen rug.\\n\\nThe execution was quick and painless. With any luck the blisters on my right hand will have healed by the time the replacement arrives. I will definitely wear cotton gloves when I use it.   \n",

multiple of these in the past few years. A couple as gifts and one for myself. Everyone who received one from me loves it. I've personally used it often enough to justify the purchase. I actually used it today for 3 new stains from my cats that happened overnight. They are no longer visible on my carpet!

I can't recommend this cleaner enough. It'll pay for itself in no time!\\n\\nEDIT: 3.5 year update. This is still a great machine but the two latches that secure in the reservoir of what you suck up have snapped long ago. There's barely a nub left to ensure they move into the locked position. Luckily, this still works fine with it just sitting in place and is still able to suck up everything just fine. At this point, I wouldn't consider any other brand/model. If anything else breaks on this, I plan on buying another one unless a new model comes out.   \n",

                       Effective Carpet Cleaner!: I must say, I am VERY pleased with this purchase. I had my carpet cleaned professionally 3 months ago, and honestly, this vacuum + Sunny Honey Pet Odor & Stain Remover Solution gets my carpets way cleaner.\\n\\nIt was pretty easy to put together (which is saying something because I am NOT mechanically-inclined).\\nIt is pretty light weight for it's size & function.\\nIt does a great job at getting all the nastiness out of my carpets, even when I just use the rinse cycle and not the wash.\\nIt also does a great job at drying...I was surprised at how much water it could suck up.\\nIt is pretty easy to clean the machine too.\\nEasy to dump out the gross stuff and put in fresh water.\\n\\nThere are THREE cycles/functions to choose from.\\n1. Rinse\\n2. Wash\\n3. Dry\\n\\nTo select the rinse or wash you just turn the knob to select which option you want. (Easy!) & then when you push/pull the cleaner, you hold the trigger button to spray out either the liquid.\\nTo use the Dry function, you just push/pull the cleaner WITHOUT holding the button.\\n\\nMy process:\\nI rinse the carpet first.\\nThen wash.\\nThen rinse again.\\nThen dry.\\n\\nThis seems to be the most effective. <3   \n",

functions. It's priced well for what you get. I got this because my entire apartment has carpet and my dog sometimes misses the potty pad. I spot treat where he misses with Nature's Miracle, but I wanted something to clean the carpets more thoroughly and with larger margins. The small holding tanks are very practical and keeps the device lightweight.\\n\\nHere is what I've found works well on eliminating pet odors with this cleaner:\\nSince my main concern with the carpets is pet odor, I mix&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nature-s-Miracle-Stain-Odor-Remover-Orange-Oxy-Gallon-5162/dp/B000XS689Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nature's Miracle Stain & Odor Remover, Orange Oxy, Gallon (5162)</a>&nbsp;and very warm tap water (about half and half) in the water container. I then put&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-2X-PetPlus-Pet-Stain-Odor-Remover-32-oz-AH30325/dp/B005NICH1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover 2X PetPlus Pet Stain & Odor Remover 32 oz, AH30325</a>&nbsp;in the solution container. I vacuum the area that I'm cleaning first (don't want to clog the bristles/filters with pet hair). I then do a couple full swoops (forward and backward) on rinse. I let the warm water and Nature's Miracle soak for a few minutes. I then do one full swoop on wash. Finally, I do a few swoops on rinse, only pressing the trigger while moving forward - not backward. If you need to get rid of the excess moisture in the carpets, continue to do slow-moving swoops without pressing the trigger (as that's what releases more \"water\"/solution) and the cleaner will suck out the excess liquid.\\n\\nTip: Unless you're cleaning a very large area of carpet, you likely do not need to fill up the solution part more than half way with this method.   \n",

Awesome!: This vacuum is great. I use it around the house in place of a regular broom. It is great on hardwood floors and tile, I have never used it on rugs. It is fairly loud but has a lot of power and continues on full force until the battery light starts blinking. Great vacuum for a small apartment, but would not be ideal for anything bigger. The battery only lasts about 15 minutes on a full charge and takes a decent amount of time (more than 15 minutes) to fully charge again. For my small one bedroom apartment (<600 sq. ft.) it was perfect! Dustbin is easy to empty. I would highly recommend this vacuum.   \n",

and tear by kids and dogs, and it manages to get alot of dirt and dust out of the rug. If you have nicer carpets, I imagine you'll achieve even better results, however I am always pleased with the performance of this machine. My kids' carpets are newer and cleaner and when there is a stain, I pull out the steam vac and it does a great job. The price is good and it is simple to operate. At the time I purchased it, I went to another site and bought replacement filters and gaskets to have at the ready should the need arise- so far so good. Also, those parts were quite cheap as well. I also enjoy using the machine. I recently bought the Hoover Floormate Hard surface  as well and I love that too.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-FH40030-FloorMate-with-SpinScrub-and-Tools/dp/B003VWZF7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover FH40030 FloorMate with SpinScrub and Tools</a>&nbsp;I made a video of that as well. No regrets about either machine.\\n\\n***UPDATE*** 05/31/2013  STILL works perfectly. Never needed any of the spare parts I ordered form Vac Parts Whse. No loss of suction, no leaks, no problems. I use it often ,too.  I am now looking into buying a newer model to see how they've improved, all though it seems that this older tank style is superior to the newer designs (lots of reports of leaking tanks on newer models).  I am just going to hope I pick the right one and get just as lucky as I did with this one.   \n",

and have moved to a rural area.  Previously we had them commercially cleaned.  There's no such service available here.  The dirt was building up.  SO I took a chance on this machine.  Because the carpets are wool, I didn't use super hot water.  Others said the machine worked well with half the amount of detergent that Hoover calls for.  It did work well, tho I had to pre-treat really dirty areas, as expected.  I didn't use the brushes because the carpets are delicate, but still got a LOT of dirt out.  I kept my \"wet\" passes down to two as recommended, used four \"dry\" passes, and put washed out plastic milk cartons under the damp carpet to facilitate drying with the help of a box fan.  The rugs felt dry in about four hours, but I kept the fans going overnight for the sake of the wood floor. Be sure to read Lissie's detailed review of the machine and avoid problems.  You'll save the purchase price pretty quickly, but I'll do it sooner since the price I paid is almost $20 less than the current one, and I got free shipping.  I haven't used the upholstery cleaning ability yet, but expect it will be quite respectable, too. Oh, don't look for how to get your carpet \"steam cleaned\" with this: it doesn't really use steam.   \n",

The frequent accidents that the residents of my house make on our light beige carpet necessitate a good carpet cleaner.\\n\\nWe had a Bissell ProHeat 2x that served us fairly well for 3-4 years, but, eventually portions of its plastic exterior began breaking off and water started seeping where it was not supposed to seep.  The design of the Bissell ProHeat was also poor.  After purchasing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Platinum-Lightweight-Upright-Vacuum-with-Canister-Bagged-UH30010COM/dp/B001PB8EEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Platinum Lightweight Upright Vacuum with Canister, Bagged, UH30010COM</a>and loving its design and abilities, my husband and I decided we would pick a Hoover to replace the Bissell.\\n\\nAssembly of this product is pretty easy; all you need is a Phillips head screwdriver to assemble the products and its various pieces.  The assembly process takes about ten minutes.  Almost everything on the Hoover SteamVac is plastic, which was kind of disappointing after our purchase of the Hoover Platinum vacuum, which employs a solid metal frame.  At this price point for a carpet cleaner, I guess it is not unexpected to have a machine that is a little less sturdy.\\n\\nIn comparing the Hoover SteamVac to our previous Bissell ProHeat 2x, one obvious benefit was the inclusion of two distinct tanks for clean and dirty water.  Having two tanks makes changing the water much easier.  The combined tank on the Bissell ProHeat was difficult to remove and was fairly large, which meant that dirty water sometimes dripped on the user.\\n\\nThe Hoover's cleaning brushes are powerful and do a really good job of churning up dirt and hair.  However, the user should use caution around delicate areas.  The device pulled up some looser fibers around a carpet seam in our living room.\\n\\nThe powered hand cleaning tool attachment works great, but securing the optional attachment is a pain.  The process involves reconfiguring the front panel of the dirty water tank and inserting the hose attachment, and then inserting the cleaning fluid attachment to a port on the front of the machine.  It works quite well once configured.\\n\\nWhile the unit employs two water tanks, the tanks are not very large.  Frequent trips to the sink are required to refill the water/empty dirty water if an individual is endeavoring to clean an entire house.  Our house is 1200 square feet but only about half of that is carpeted.  I estimate that four trips were made to empty and refill the water compartments.  In all fairness though, it had been about 2 months since we last cleaned the carpet and we do have four pets.\\n\\nFor all the back and forth to the sink, this machine produces results.  It picks up dirt very, very well.  It's not as fast and does not have as much capacity as a commercial unit, and compared to the Bissell ProHeat has a smaller sweeping width, but the Hoover leaves carpet very clean.  The unit also leaves carpets fairly dry after a couple of passes.\\n\\nOverall I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars. It seems to be a very good carpet cleaner for the money, but the construction seems rather flimsy in places and the process for affixing attachments should have been thought out more.   \n",

                          It works! Very happy with this purchase.: This works amazingly well and is so easy even I can do it. Lightweight, which I needed. Easy to remove water containers. Our carpet was riddled with pet stains that didn't get cleaned well enough at the time. After a couple of runs with this little dynamo - they are gone! Naturally, newly soiled areas come up right away with this, but the real test for me was on the old stains, and I'm sold. It's not any larger than my vacuum so it's easy to store. I haven't even used the accessories yet, but for the carpet, it's amazing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Power-Scrub-Deluxe-Carpet-Cleaner-FH50150/dp/B009ZJ2M7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Cleaner, FH50150</a>   \n",

A couple of months ago, it began leaking, and then the leaking got progressively worse. Last week, it began leaking so much that by the time I got to the carpet to clean, the water tank was half full. So, I took it apart, found the leaking part, which is a pathetically weak piece of plastic. Even the plastic clips would not stand up to opening them. But I glued the crap out of it, using waterproof glue, and hey, now it works. For now.\\n\\nHowever, the attachment no longer works, because it relies on a piece of plastic to pull another piece of plastic. The second piece of plastic got a little sticky, for some reason, and when I pulled back on the trigger, the first piece of plastic came apart. It isn't fixable. It's just a terrible piece of engineering--kinda like the first pathetically weak piece of plastic.\\n\\nWhile it lasted, this thing cleaned pretty well. But for our next carpet cleaner, I think we're going to try getting something that isn't built for the lifespan of a typical hamster.\\n\\nThe main things about this carpet cleaner are its light weight and improved suction over earlier models. I've been using a older Hoover model, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-F6215-900-SteamVac-Agility-Carpet-Cleaner/dp/B0002MR7A2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover F6215-900 SteamVac Agility Carpet Cleaner</a>, which is about as agile as an elephant on ice. The FH50150PC weighs about seven pounds less, but it's also easier to push around because--I think--it holds less liquid than the earlier model. My overall impression is that Hoover put a little more design effort into the newer model, but it could still be better.\\n\\nThe carpet cleaning solution is probably the best indicator of cleaning ability; I've used Hoover's (expensive) solution for a while, and it works well, though it's made of pretty strong chemicals; it irritates my skin. But it has removed some really bad stains--cranberry juice, for example. I like that the solution goes into one tank and water into another, so I don't have to mix them, but the water tank is small (but again, lightweight, so easier to handle). Between the solution tank, the water tank, and the dirty-water tank, I was shutting the cleaner off and filling or emptying tanks quite often, but it's easy to do and, again, makes the cleaner light, so that's okay with me. I did often forget to move the switch from wash to rinse, though, which then meant that I had to go back over the same spots.\\n\\nHowever, while the solution could lift stains when used with the old Hoover, its poor suction meant that it just spread them out, unless I went over and over the carpet. Sometimes I would press down on the front of the cleaner with my foot to gain extra suction (picture the ergonomics of that). The new Hoover's suction is much better, and as a result, it removes dirty water much more efficiently. Even more importantly, because it sucks up water better, carpets are dry much sooner. With the old model, if I were planning a dinner party, I'd have to plan to clean the carpets early in the morning, run the house fan, open the windows, and make sure I cleaned the carpets in common areas first so that they would be dry before anyone showed up. With the new model, our carpets were dry in two hours.\\n\\nOur house has white carpet, and I have two young kids. So, even with strong solution and good suction, I still have to go over carpet multiple times, or else the carpet looks dingy. Actually, it still looks dingy, but it does look better than it did before cleaning. I think the point is that, for the price, this is probably the best you're going to get.\\n\\nThe included tools are nearly identical to the ones that shipped with the older Hoover; the spinning brush works okay, except that spraying solution from it is messy and inaccurate, and the brush is so bulky that it's difficult to get into crevices and small spaces, like auto interiors.\\n\\nThe cleaner is noisy (about the same as the older model). I wear hearing protection. The cord is unnecessarily short, so you can only do one room before having to unplug and replug.\\n\\nThe construction of the unit is okay; it doesn't seem as sturdy as the older model, but for the weight savings, I'm fine with that. The handle does not fold, though; that was a nice feature on the older model.\\n\\nI also find the array of Hoover models to be quite confusing. The price range is very narrow, and some units are priced identically. The weights vary; the inclusion of tools varies; every unit seems like a compromise.\\n\\nNevertheless, this model is an improvement over the older model, and makes me a little less reluctant to clean carpets.   \n",

this vacuum: I LOVE<LOVE<LOVE this product at a great price too ! This little vacuum picks up very well, is so light and easy to use.....and no cords to deal with. I purchased an extra battery so that I always have one charged and ready. It is particularly handy around the eating table, picking up the crumbs after a meal..........especially if you have young children. Definitely recommend, well worth the price.   \n",

I've tried many carpet cleaners & non of them would suck up the water very well if at all. This Hoover steamvac works fabulous at cleaning pet stained carpets or heavily trafficked carpets. You'll know when the carpets are thoroughly cleaned. You can view the cleaner sucking up the dirt & water through the transparent front top cover.\\n\\nIt may take you 3 or more cleanings to get it cleaned, depending on your carpets, however you can do it w/o worrying about any excess water remaining as it gets sucked up quickly. Impressive Indeed. This is where it gets ugly or fugly seeing what comes out of your carpets is very revealing & perhaps embarrassing?\\n\\nUse boiling hot water with a large funnel when pouring into clean water tank. Just be careful & use common sense. The clean hot boiling water works like magic for lifting up the dirt & soap from carpet. Be careful with any sudsy cleaner you use, less is best.\\n\\nConsider adding your favorite essential oil (about 6-7 drops) to the clean water tank. I added pine. It works as a subtle deodorizer & fragrance for your carpet. White vinegar added to the clean water tank the clean boiling water works great at deodorizing & neutralizing cat or dog urine. Pine Sol may work too when added.\\n\\nThe powered hand tool with spinning brush worked beyond my expectations for cleaning upholstery, cat stands etc as good as the carpet cleaner does.\\n\\nNote: If & when your Hoover SteamVac Spinscrub is not suctioning up the water from carpet or is blowing air then\\n\\nHere's how to quickly fix this issue: (copy & pasted from elsewhere, so excuse the all CAPS)\\n\\nITS THE DUCT PIECE ON THE FRONT OF THE DIRTY WATER TANK (DWT). ITS NOT LINED UP.\\nNote: where you attach the upholstery tool next to & adjust to use\\n\\n1. TAKE LID OFF OF DWT\\n\\n2. SLIDE THE LITTLE SQUARE PIECE (5'X5'X1) (THE DUCT) ON THE FRONT OF THE DWT AS FAR UP AS POSSIBLE AND IF IT BENDS FORWARD FROM THE TOP, DO THAT TOO (SOME MODELS OPEN LIKE A DOOR TOP DOWN, OTHERS JUST SLIDE UP AND OUT COMPLETELY)\\n\\n3. SLIDE THAT DUCT BACK DOWN AS FAR DOWN AND BACK AS IT WILL GO.\\n\\n4. PUT THE LID BACK ON BY HINGING THE FRONT LATCHES ON AND THEN SNAPPING THE BACK SIDE DOWN.\\n\\n5. CHECK TO SEE IF THAT DUCT PIECE ON THE FRONT IS LOOSE BY PUSHING ON IT AND SEEING IF IT MOVES UP AND DOWN.\\n\\nIF IT IS, THE LID ISNT COMPLETELY ON, GO BACK TO STEP 4.\\nIF THE DUCT IS SNUG, CONGRATS YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST MADE YOUR STEAM VAC **** UP THE WATER AGAIN\\n\\nNow the bad...\\n\\nRegarding the 1 star reviews the turbine within the Hoover SteamVac Spinscrub eventually fails, however this part is available thru amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Turbine-Assembly-Gear-2-Left-Port-F5914-900-Fh50044/dp/B00Y33IU48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Turbine, Assembly Gear 2 Left Port F5914-900 Fh50044</a>\\n\\nWhich is Part Number 440007513 Turbine & the gear assembly comes with an updated spin scrub block brush part number #44007359.\\n\\nRegardless of what machine you buy this part will eventually have to be replaced due to Hoover not using stainless steel screws internally. They'll eventually rust & lock up. So make sure you empty out the water of both clean & dirty water tanks out of after you're done to prolong the life, before storing.\\n\\nYes, I was really disappointed to hear this, but this is as good as it gets regarding a quality carpet cleaner, regardless how much you spend for any carpet cleaning machine. This machine lasted me 4 years before needing to replace the turbine, which anybody can easily replace.\\n\\nI hope this review helped you, please let me know if you appreciate this, by clicking on the yes button below.

Much better then the Bissel Pro Cleaner.  Very easy to use.  Took me half the time to steam clean then it did with the Bissel.  I was amazed at how much more dirt came up with the Hoover SteamVac.  Very glad I bought it!\\n\\nUpdate - Lasted almost 3 years.  Pretty good for plastic steamer.  Just bought a Hoover Power Scrub SpinScrub 50 to replace it and it's much easier to use but I don't expect it to last more then a couple of years.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Power-Scrub-Deluxe-Carpet-Washer-FH50150/dp/B009ZJ2M7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Washer,  FH50150</a>   \n",

I have 2 cats and regularly scheduled carpet cleaning is a must, although I don't do it so often that the areas where spliced come apart...I made that mistake with my first carpet. Everything in moderation so I use my carpet cleaners only twice a year.\\n\\nThis Hoover SteamVac does a much better job than my old Bissel Pro-Heat...granted I did love the Pro-Heat's ability to warm the water up inside the machine, which this Hoover does not do....but the bristles on the Hoover do a much better job at cleaning the deep-down dirt. This machine is also much easier to clean after using (cat hair, etc.).\\n\\nInstead of using the shampoo that comes with the machine, I use Nature's Miracle carpet shampoo....I feel it's safer for my cats than the harsh chemicals in the Hoover shampoo.\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nature-s-Miracle-Green-Leaf-Hydorgen-Perozide-Carpet-Shampoo-24-oz/dp/B00TQQY7L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nature's Miracle Green Leaf Hydorgen Perozide Carpet Shampoo, 24 oz</a>   \n",

Using this machine on hard floors without proper attachment may scratch or damage your floor.\"  This might be true for wood floors, but I've had no problems using it on my kitchen tile floor.  Even though I recently cleaned my floor with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Scooba/dp/B000GB568O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Scooba</a>&nbsp;(which also has a clean solution tank and a dirty solution tank), the SteamVac picked up dirty grey solution from my supposedly clean floor.\\n\\nWhile the manual recommends holding the trigger and pushing the cleaner forward then back to apply solution, then releasing the trigger and pushing forward and back once to vacuum the solution up, on the tile floor I discovered that it takes three forward/back passes to pick up most of the water on the tile surface, and another to get most of the water off the grout.  I'm going to guess that one forward/back motion will not be enough to get most of the water out of carpet.\\n\\nUpholstery: I tested the hand tools on well-used fabric-covered office chairs.  As I wrestled with the hand tools, I realized that this would be a job more easily done with a spray bottle, a scrub brush, and a wet/dry shop vac.  I used the hand tool with the brush to spray solution.  The solution sprays in a thin wide pattern.  This is great for large flat areas, like the back of the office chairs, but for narrow or curved areas I got overspray everywhere.  (On the bright side, I now know that the cleaning solution won't damage my carpet, other furniture, or clothing.)\\n\\nThe brush tool is large and awkward to fit into tight spaces.  The vacuum only tool is easier to get into the curved and tight areas in an office chair, but of course the whole 4-inch plus vacuum area has to be in contact with the upholstery or it won't pick up solution.  Both tools worked well on the back of the chair, which is pretty clean, but were difficult to use on places like the top edge of the chair, which gets handled all the time and is quite dirty.  A simple narrow pointed attachment (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/this-one/dp/B006C2GATA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">this one</a>, WHICH DOES NOT FIT THIS VAC), would be perfect for rounded or tight places.  The hose also doesn't handle twisting well, and it takes some effort to twist the tool into position so it is flat on the surface.  It's no problem for me, but someone with arthritis or other hand or wrist problems might have trouble with it.\\n\\nI'll be testing this on carpet soon, and I'll update this review then.   \n",

I was concerned about if the carpet would dry in time and almost didn't use it, but then one of my thoughtful cats decided to decorate the living room with his latest \"Hair Balls Tinged With Orange Cat Treats\" art piece.  I thanked my lucky stars that the cleaner came with a bottle of cleaner fluid because I was running against a clock and losing big time.  I shoved all of my furniture into my tiny kitchen to get it off the carpet and ran the vacuum a few times until the canister was coming back \"clean\".  Then after a quick trial & error of operation, I got the Hoover to work (with no time for a spot test and hoping it wouldn't end up being my ultimate folly).\\n\\nThe first pass came back with filthy black water.  The orange spots didn't want to come out at first (I should have pre-treated them, but was in panic mode), but the Cleaning Surge mode scrubbed them right out.  I got curious and used the surge on some nacho cheese stains that my husband added to the carpet last year. I squealed like a kid at Christmas when I saw my bright beautiful white carpet show it's pretty face after a couple passes!!!  I then tackled the stains on the dining room carpet and our heavy traffic hallway.  I had to dump the water container 6 times and every time it came out black. I think I would have kept going & let my guests show up/go hungry if I hadn't run out of cleaning liquid.  I can't tell you how happy I was for one night to have a house that looked & smelled perfect!  (Yes, i <3 the smell of the cleaning liquid.  It is fantastically floral!)  Alas, two outdoor cats who love to track in red clay, a husband that tends to miss the trashcan, and my own tendency to forget to take off my shoes at home means that within a week the carpet was back to its normal wear & tear look.\\n\\nMy personal choice for buying this product was because of the other amazon reviews on it.  We decided to outright purchase a steam cleaner because renting one for 75$/day (+cleaner) seemed less frugal than just outright buying one for 140$ on sale.  It was simple to use, didn't leak, and best of all:  My carpet was COMPLETELY DRY within 20 minutes of using it. I had plenty of time to vacuum one more time and put all my furniture back without my dinner schedule being totally thrown off whack.\\n\\nLOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!   \n",

Power scrub: I am very pleased with the Hoover Power scrub. Previously I rented a carpet shampooer. The Hoover does a much better job. It was simple to put together and the instructions and operation are easily understood. The finished product is excellent..It even comes with tools which I have not used yet. But I am very happy with the Hoover. I have had it about a week and have cleaned the family room, a 9x12 area rug and the hallway. It has a wash cycle and a rinse cycle and a clean water holder and a dirty water holder and they are easy to attach and remove to empty.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-FH50150-Carpet-Basics-Power-Scrub-Deluxe-Carpet-Cleaner/dp/B009ZJ2M7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover FH50150 Carpet Basics Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Cleaner</a>   \n",

Does the job as well as most professional rug cleaners but only for a lot less money. Being somewhat familiar with professional rug cleaners, I know the best cleaning system used by industrial professionals is the \"rotary-steam extraction method\", which employs one man with a rotary brush machine followed by a man with a steam vac (quite similar to the Hover SteamVac system).  Most domestic professionals use the \"steam extraction\" method, which does a fairly decent job. This method is used mainly because it is cost effective allowing only one man to do the job.\\nHoover came up with the technology that combines both the rotary and extraction method at the same time in one machine. A far superior system available to the public for around $150 bucks, quite remarkable!\\nSome ideas I have to improve your rug-cleaning job:\\n1. Use boiling water not hot tap water. The difference between 120 and 212 degrees is significant. The higher temperature disinfects as well as breaks down the dirt and grime without harming the machine.  The reason Hoover states hot tap water is liability.\\n2. The backstroke vacuums up the most water. So you can move the forward \"drying\" stroke a lot faster to get to the backstroke which extracts the most water. Make sure to use the backstroke very slowly.\\n3. Keep the machine as close to vertical as comfortable when in the drying backstroke to put more weight at the front of the machine where the suction actually takes place.\\n4. When the recovery tank is full you will hear a change in engine pitch and see the yellow ball at the top of the tank. Shut the machine off and wait until the ball drops and you can get a few more washing or drying strokes in before the tank is completely full.\\n5. Pretreat the real dirty spots with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/RESOLVE-CARPET-CLEANER-22-oz/dp/B000VPE89S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">RESOLVE CARPET CLEANER 22 oz.</a>and then use the SteamVac to go over them first and if all else fails use the powered hand tool-a little more work, but definitely worth it.\\n6. It's best to move the machine to a tiled surface (kitchen or bath)-any water spilled is off the rug.\\n7. Change both tanks at the same time (empty lower and fill upper) and save yourself alot of extra trips to the sink.   \n",

overcomplicated and under-whelmed by cleaning results: After the tremendous disappointment with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BISSELL-ProHeat-Upright-Deep-Cleaner-25A3/dp/B001DEXA86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BISSELL ProHeat Upright Deep Cleaner, 25A3</a>&nbsp;I opted to switch to a different brand to try something different.  While there's a lot that I like about the Hoover F5914-900 there's a lot NOT to like.  For starters it doesn't do as good a job on deep cleaning carpets as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BISSELL-ProHeat-Upright-Deep-Cleaner-25A3/dp/B001DEXA86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BISSELL ProHeat Upright Deep Cleaner, 25A3</a>&nbsp;and I frequently have to switch to the hand tool to clean bad spots.  That said the Hoover doesn't pull up so many carpet fibers and track them around.  Speaking of the wand attachment/hand I've never used a machine that had such a complicated, time-consuming means of attaching it for use.  It requires leaning the handle and Clean Water Tank back to access the Dirty Water Tank.  In the process water leaks out of the Clean Water Tank requiring a whole new clean up.  Attaching the hose requires opening the Dirty Water Tank (disgusting), sliding out a panel (which isn't easy, nor is getting it back in!), and then attaching the end of the hose to the tank and a separate water line.  Pretty simple eh?  Score one for Bissell where you simply turned a dial and powered it on.  Disconnecting the hose is similarly complicated and still more water leaks out (Yay!).  Suffice to say if you need this for quick cleanups you're better served by a smaller devise or simply leave the cleaning wand attached at all times.  That said, the rotating cleaning wand worked VERY well...the tradeoff is the general mess left behind.  The floor/carpet cleaning is decidedly so-so and my hunch is after using this for a while you'll still want to spring for one of the truly heavy duty cleaning machines or have a service come in and do it.\\n\\nAll in all, the Hoover F5914-900 is something of a disappointment as it does nothing particularly well.  If you need a knockabout general use machine I'm sure this is fine.  If you have pets or entertain frequently and need to clean up various spills this is NOT the machine for you.  Maybe I'm a bit extreme and simply need a machine that is specific for spot cleaning and treatment and another for general carpet clearning and that's probably where I'm headed.  But to my mind the Hoover F5914-900 is the Jack of all trades and the master of none.   \n",

wonderfully this model which is half the price cleans on par of the proheat 1x.\\n\\nWhile it does not have any heat at all, it is well built for the money spent.\\nThis is made out of plastic, and can feel \"cheap\" as some have said.\\nBut it does the job well, and cleans my old carpets up great.\\n\\nPros\\n-The Multi-Spin brushes that are removable for cleaning\\n-Two tank system, no more bladder yuck.\\n-Comes with a plastic wand device to clean hair out of vac tube area\\n-Holder for brush handle on top\\n\\nCon\\n- You have to disconnect the hole system to connect the hand tool. So you have to plan ahead on doing this such as first or last  but I have found that in some ways this could prevent the leaking that I Bessel is known for (I had two models from the hand tool leak so this solves that to a point but I'd rather have a disconnecting slot on the back)\\n-Not very wide, and the tank fills up fast.\\n\\nBut this is what you get with a cheaper small model.\\n\\nAlso don't get the \"pet\" version.\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-SteamVac-Pet-Complete-Carpet-Cleaner-with-Clean-Surge-F5918900/dp/B0016NL1SK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover SteamVac Pet Complete Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge - F5918900</a>\\nAll they did is repackage this model with \"pet cleaner\" which you could pick up cheaper in a bigger oz bottle. It does not feature any other feature that this model does not. Save the ten dollars and in my opinion they should have these two at the same price.\\n\\nI can recommend this, it will clean your carpets for those who do not want to spend that much money.   \n",

It has done a good job of cleaning our carpets, which are kept dirty by three dogs. We reviewed the MaxExtract last year, and recently had a chance to compare those two against the PowerScrub. Here's how they compare.\\n\\nCLEANING PERFORMANCE:\\nA three-way tie. I used Hoover Premium Pet Formula Carpet/Upholstery Detergent in all three machines, according to the instructions for each (premix for the SteamVac, separate compartments for the other two). We cleaned separate sections of big spots with each machine. To our eyes, they were equally clean when wet, and also when dry. All three units are loud, like every other carpet cleaner.\\n\\nCLEANING CONVENIENCE:\\nThe PowerScrub and the MaxExtract have a very nice feature: You add the detergent to a separate compartment from the hot water. A switch enables you to spray mixed detergent solution, or plain water. One complaint we had after using the SteamVac for several years is that the sections of carpet with the worst stains would sometimes get dirty again fast. These deeply stained areas got a lot of detergent sprayed on them during cleaning, and we believe the stains might come back due to detergent buildup in the carpet. With the newer PowerScrub and MaxExtract models, you can switch to plain water and rinse these areas (or your whole carpet!)\\n\\nThe SteamVac has a Clean Surge feature that applies extra solution to stains and heavy traffic areas. I never found this to work any better than a just passing over the area again the normal way.\\n\\nHOW WET WERE THE CARPETS AFTER CLEANING:\\nThe carpets were noticeably dryer with this MaxExtract model. If you live in a colder area, or a humid area, this could be a deciding factor for you. The MaxExtract carpet fully dried in about half the time that the SteamVac carpet took. The PowerScrub carpets seemed slightly dryer than the SteamVac, but not as dry as the MaxExtract.\\n\\nHOW MUCH DETERGENT THEY USE:\\nAn unexpected outcome was that the PowerScrub and MaxExtract use significantly more detergent than the SteamVac-my guess is 50-100% more. Even using the maximum recommended amount of detergent in the SteamVac, it uses less.\\n\\nCLEAN WATER/DETERGENT TANK:\\nThe MaxExtract and PowerScrub hot water and detergent tank is easier to fill because pre-mixing is not necessary. This is not a huge deal, but the MaxExtract and PowerScrub are clearly newer machines with nice refinements in this area.\\n\\nDIRTY WATER TANK:\\nThe PowerScrub wins big points for its redesigned dirty water tank. It has a plug that you open to pour out the dirty water. This is MUCH easier than the MaxExtract or the SteamVac, both of which require you to take off the lid to pour out the water. With the PowerScrub, you use the spout to pour out dirty water, then only take of the lid once at the end of the day to rinse the tank and sponge filter. When you clean a lot of carpets, this kind of refinement matters.\\n\\nUPHOLSTERY CLEANING:\\nThe SteamVac and the PowerScrub include a SpinScrub hand tool with a spinning brush. We found this tool to be nearly useless. It seems like a lot of the suction power that comes down the hose is used just to spin the brush, so there is less suction left to suck out the dirty water. We found the simple Carpet and Upholstery Tool included with all three machines worked much better.\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nSteamVac: Costs less to buy and use, but this is an older machine that does not have the refinements of the other two. Leaves carpets wetter, and may leave more detergent in the carpet unless you empty the detergent tank and fill it with water only.\\nMaxExtract: As its name suggests, leaves carpets drier than the other machines. Allows you to rinse with water.\\nPowerScrub: Easiest emptying of the dirty water tank, which is very nice. Allows you to rinse with water.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\nIf you are cost conscious, buy the SteamVac. If you want the easiest experience, buy the PowerScrub. If you want dryer carpets quicker, buy the MaxExtract. You will get clean carpets with all three machines.\\n\\n2016 UPDATES:\\nFirst, the Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Washer,  FH50150 has been updated since we bought it about 10 years ago. The photos show a model that is very similar looking to ours, but with somewhat different details. The key points APPEAR to be the same, but I cannot tell because we have the old model, not the new one.\\n\\nSecond, I definitely prefer models with the RINSE feature at this point. This allows you to remove more detergent from your carpet by running across each section with plain water after washing.\\n\\nThird, the chart supplied by hoover is WRONG on one detail: The MaxExtract 77 model clearly has a RINSE/WASH knob in the photos, but does not show a RINSE feature in the chart. The knob is grey, below the red round Hoover logo in the photos.\\n\\nFinally, at this time (last week of December 2015) the price for the MaxExtract is just twenty more than the price of the other two (prices may change). At that price, I would recommend the MaxExtract 60 over the other two models.   \n",

Yeah, I could have rented a machine and solution for about $40 but how many times have I rented a machine that needed cleaning before use or did not work properly? Too many times. So, by spending $159 with FREE shipping with Amazon Prime, I can spot clean or do a whole room or lend to my friend a great machine that cleans well.

I can only give you my personal experience with this one. My husband assembled this for me, and says it was very simple to do. The manual wasn't very clear to me on how to use or assemble the attachments. Even so, I probably could have at least used the main part without consulting the manual.\\n\\nIf your carpets are older and/or have never been cleaned, you're in for a real treat here. Not only will you SEE how much disgusting gunk has been lurking in your carpet, you'll SMELL it when you empty the container. This is something you'll want to take outside and clean out with your garden hose each time you use it. Clean the brushes, the attachment and the tank every time. Trust me, you don't want that stuff sitting around waiting to be spilled or smelled, especially if you're using this to clean up pet accidents.\\n\\nFor a general carpet cleaning, you'll want to vacuum first to get up particles and dust. Otherwise you just end up with hair and chunks caught in the brushes and in the front part where the cleaning solution gets sucked back in. That front area traps quite a bit of pet hair (German shepherd in my case), and you need to keep it clear to get the full benefit. The unit comes with this long flat black rubbery squiggly thing for the express purpose of cleaning that slot. If you lose it like I did, one of those Draino snakes will do the trick.\\n\\nFill the clean water tank with cleaning solution and water according to the instructions. I've seen some other recipes for cleaning, including use of boiling water and other cleaning chemicals. I have no idea how this might affect the shampooer, its efficacy or safety. I've tried pre-soaking and doing a post-cleaning \"rinse\" by sprinkling on plain water, but that's the only deviation from instructions I've done.\\n\\nAnyway, get it all together, turn it on and start cleaning. Press a button on the handle to release water/cleaning solution as you go forward, and release it as you go backward to let the brushes and suction remove the liquid and dirt. It's tempting to go fast like you would with a vacuum, but you'll want to slow down and take your time with it. The slower you go, the more solution gets in and the more time it has to penetrate. As you go back slowly, the brushes have more time to loosen dirt, and more liquid is removed, making drying time shorter.\\n\\nOne feature I love is the two separate tanks--one for clean water, and one for dirty water. You never spray dirty water back onto your carpet with this machine. The tanks are very easy to remove for emptying and filling, too. They just snap back into place--no confusing dials to tighten or worrying you didn't get it on right, possibly causing a leak. There's also no confusion about which tank goes where.\\n\\nThe suction power on this thing is outstanding. I thought I would be stepping in wet spots for days after a cleaning, but it's completely dry within a few hours. This varies with how much liquid was on the carpet in the first place, but even a soaked spot is dry within a day. The scrubbing brushes loosen the dirt and help get even more gunk out. I use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Platinum-Collection-Pet-Plus-Carpet-and-Upholstery-Detergent-50-Ounces-AH30035/dp/B001U3WKFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Platinum Collection Pet Plus Carpet-and-Upholstery Detergent, 50 Ounces, AH30035</a>&nbsp;with this, and it has completely removed fresh stains every single time. My success with older stains has varied with type and age. If it doesn't remove an older stain, it usually makes it fade.\\n\\nI was afraid with a new puppy that I was going to have a smelly house, and there wouldn't be anything I could do about it. My husband thinks the house actually smells better since we got the dog because I am constantly cleaning the carpets and spot cleaning the furniture. The ultimate test was my mother, who could not smell ANYTHING when she came for a visit. If my mom can't smell anything after using this carpet cleaner, you won't either. This is a worthwhile investment with or without pets, for a cleaner, healthier, better-smelling house.   \n",

I don't know why I kept renting carpet shampooers from my local grocery store all these years, especially when we have an apartment above the garage and we can amortize the expense. It's true, what other reviewers say, that the plastic feels flimsy, but I feel confident after using it on six different rooms and a set of very dirty stairs that it's not going to break unless I do something stupid. It's also true that the holding tank is small. (This became less annoying after a marathon 8-hour carpet cleaning day when my arm began to get tired.) For these two reasons I would have given it four and a half stars had that been an option. I rounded up to five stars because it's done an amazing job getting my carpets and stairs clean. I particularly like the ability to switch back and forth between the rinse and wash settings.\\n\\nI tried it first on our back door entryway with just plain hot water, and there was black sludge -- literally -- in the used water tank. I had read in other reviews that wetting the carpet first with plain water made the clean cycle more effective, and I did an experiment to see how much dirt I could get out of the carpet with just water. I used three tanks' worth of hot water on a 9'x12' FLOR rug (which is not supposed to be shampooed, but I ignore that) before turning it to wash. Then I did just one wash pass and switched back to rinse. I've been using this method with all my carpets and it works really well, and saves on cleaning fluid. I ordered&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-CLEANPLUS-2X-64oz-Carpet-Cleaner-and-Deodorizer-AH30330/dp/B005CWK0FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover CLEANPLUS 2X 64oz Carpet Cleaner and Deodorizer, AH30330</a>&nbsp;from Amazon and got Hoover's Deep Cleansing Spot and Stain Remover ($5.97 as an add-on) -- I'm glad I did because the stain remover spray got out some stains that the shampooer couldn't. In some rooms I saw foam on the rinse setting, which I think was residual shampoo left from previous cleanings. The cleaning solution has a strong but pleasant odor which disappears when the carpet dries.\\n\\nThe FH50150 is loud -- I wore ear protection. The stair tool worked well although I did find that if I got too artistic while spraying, the water cut off. The instructions say to keep the nozzle low. I used the SpinScrub Powered Hand Tool on landings. The crevice tool was handy for the edges of wall to wall carpeting, especially around doors. (While the upright gets fairly close to walls, it does leave a 1/4\" along the wall uncleaned.) Sometimes the tank-full cutoff activated before the tank was full; I could override that by restarting the machine. Note: it is described as an \"automatic shut-off\" but it doesn't actually shut off -- the suction stops, which you can hear as a higher pitched whine. I tried the upholstery tool on a rounded seat cushion and was a little alarmed at how wet it got, but it dried out within a day. The leaking others report only occurred for me when I was working on area rugs, and the instructions said to bring a towel to sit it on, good advice. (The instructions, in fact, are full of don't-do-this! and don't-do-that! but it was much, much easier to assemble and use than the instructions made it seem.) I'm looking forward to tackling upholstery next -- if I encounter any problems I'll update this review.   \n",

                                  Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac: This Hoover SteamVac performed as advertised and beyond.  I had been using another brand to clean my rugs and bought this as replacement; wow, I couldn't believe the amount of dirt removed.  I found the machine is easy to use, instructions are clear, the attachments are stored in compartments located on the steamer, carpets dried quickly.  I love it!<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-F5914-900-SteamVac-with-Clean-Surge/dp/B00009R66F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surge</a>   \n",

href=\"/Hoover-Linx-Cordless-Stick-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B001PB8EJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner</a>\\nThis is the best cordless vacuum I have ever owned. I am a mother of two toddlers and have no pets. I have most recently used the Electrolux Ergorapido cordless stick vacuum, which is ok on hard floors but terrible on carpets and can't pick up anything the size of a cheerio. I also own a rainbow, as my main (once a week vacuum), which is fabulous and powerful but big, bulky and corded. Since I have purchaced the Hoover Linx, I have not touched my rainbow. The Hoover works amazingly well on my carpets and on my hard floors. The power of this cordless vaccum is shocking, and it cleans right up to the very edge of the wood work. It is a bit difficult to manuver on stairs, but still much easier then dealing with a cord and heavy vaccum. I do wish it had attachments to clean under couch cushions, etc. but I still can't give this one any less then 5 stars. I can vaccum my entire 1800sf house and still have battery life left. I had been eyeing this vacuum for quite a while, but did not buy it right away because I thought it was pricey for a stick vaccum. I was so wrong. I never want to be without this thing and it's worth every penny.   \n",

All but one room looked like original carpets, and they probably hadn't been cleaned in over 5 years. Almost every foot was covered in dark stains, and it all had a very pungent odor. Was definitely soiled heavily by dogs from the previous owner. I used this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Platinum-Collection-Pet-Plus-Carpet-and-Upholstery-Detergent-50-Ounces-AH30035/dp/B001U3WKFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Platinum Collection Pet Plus Carpet-and-Upholstery Detergent, 50 Ounces, AH30035</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ryter-Odormute-Pet-Odor-Eliminator-Concentrate-Unscented/dp/B0002D3250/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ryter Odormute Pet Odor Eliminator Concentrate (Unscented)</a>&nbsp;to thoroughly clean. The first time through the entire house I had to make 4 passes over each area, twice with the \"surge\" button depressed. This literally got out every single stain throughout the whole house, and got rid of the smell completely! Our hideous carpet now looks cleaner then most peoples newer carpet!\\n\\nI had a 10 year old steamvac previously that had lost its suction, and this replaced it nicely. To do general cleaning you just need to do one forward clean stroke and one suction back stroke. The surge button works good for any real stains or soiled areas. The hose and attachment works decently for stairs, no where near as well as the actual base unit though. The top solution container and bottom waste container are easy to remove/refill/clean, however I wish they were a bit larger. I can easily go through 10+ containers just to do our den (since we're septic I dump the waste container outside far away from the house too - so it's a pain). Also make sure you keep the brushes clean underneath, so they can scrub the carpet well.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this unit compare to our last is how well it dries. If you need the area dried quickly - just make an additional sucking pass - and usually the floor is virtually completely dry within the hour! It works well enough that you can walk around with socks on immediately afterwards and not get extremely damp feet. Our old steamvac model didn't dry nearly as well, it was several hours after cleaning until it was completely dry.   \n",

Bissell, and I just want to know:  Why didn't I do this sooner???? This machine is FAAAAAAN-tastic!  I could shampoo my carpets all day with this thing.  This machine actually makes shampooing the carpet NOT that terrible of a chore!   \n",
       "6437  2013 UPDATE: Comparison of Three Hoover Carpet Cleaner Models: This is a head-to-head review of three Hoover carpet cleaners that are currently featured on the comparison chart on on the product page:\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Power-Scrub-Deluxe-Carpet-Washer-FH50150/dp/B009ZJ2M7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Washer,  FH50150</a>\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-SteamVac-Carpet-Cleaner-with-Clean-Surge-F5914-900/dp/B00009R66F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900</a>\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-MaxExtract-60-PressurePro-Carpet-Deep-Cleaner-FH50220/dp/B0043VSR8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover MaxExtract 60 PressurePro Carpet Deep Cleaner, FH50220</a>\\n\\nWe've had this SteamVac for about 5 years. It has done a good job of cleaning our carpets, which are kept dirty by three dogs. We reviewed the MaxExtract last year, and recently had a chance to compare those two against the PowerScrub. Here's how they compare.\\n\\nCLEANING PERFORMANCE:\\nA three-way tie. I used Hoover Premium Pet Formula Carpet/Upholstery Detergent in all three machines, according to the instructions for each (premix for the SteamVac, separate compartments for the other two). We cleaned separate sections of big spots with each machine. To our eyes, they were equally clean when wet, and also when dry. All three units are loud, like every other carpet cleaner.\\n\\nCLEANING CONVENIENCE:\\nThe PowerScrub and the MaxExtract have a very nice feature: You add the detergent to a separate compartment from the hot water. A switch enables you to spray mixed detergent solution, or plain water. One complaint we had after using the SteamVac for several years is that the sections of carpet with the worst stains would sometimes get dirty again fast. These deeply stained areas got a lot of detergent sprayed on them during cleaning, and we believe the stains might come back due to detergent buildup in the carpet. With the newer PowerScrub and MaxExtract models, you can switch to plain water and rinse these areas (or your whole carpet!)\\n\\nThe SteamVac has a Clean Surge feature that applies extra solution to stains and heavy traffic areas. I never found this to work any better than a just passing over the area again the normal way.\\n\\nHOW WET WERE THE CARPETS AFTER CLEANING:\\nThe carpets were noticeably dryer with this MaxExtract model. If you live in a colder area, or a humid area, this could be a deciding factor for you. The MaxExtract carpet fully dried in about half the time that the SteamVac carpet took. The PowerScrub carpets seemed slightly dryer than the SteamVac, but not as dry as the MaxExtract.\\n\\nHOW MUCH DETERGENT THEY USE:\\nAn unexpected outcome was that the PowerScrub and MaxExtract use significantly more detergent than the SteamVac-my guess is 50-100% more. Even using the maximum recommended amount of detergent in the SteamVac, it uses less.\\n\\nCLEAN WATER/DETERGENT TANK:\\nThe MaxExtract and PowerScrub hot water and detergent tank is easier to fill because pre-mixing is not necessary. This is not a huge deal, but the MaxExtract and PowerScrub are clearly newer machines with nice refinements in this area.\\n\\nDIRTY WATER TANK:\\nThe PowerScrub wins big points for its redesigned dirty water tank. It has a plug that you open to pour out the dirty water. This is MUCH easier than the MaxExtract or the SteamVac, both of which require you to take off the lid to pour out the water. With the PowerScrub, you use the spout to pour out dirty water, then only take of the lid once at the end of the day to rinse the tank and sponge filter. When you clean a lot of carpets, this kind of refinement matters.\\n\\nUPHOLSTERY CLEANING:\\nThe SteamVac and the PowerScrub include a SpinScrub hand tool with a spinning brush. We found this tool to be nearly useless. It seems like a lot of the suction power that comes down the hose is used just to spin the brush, so there is less suction left to suck out the dirty water. We found the simple Carpet and Upholstery Tool included with all three machines worked much better.\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nSteamVac: Costs less to buy and use, but this is an older machine that does not have the refinements of the other two. Leaves carpets wetter, and may leave more detergent in the carpet unless you empty the detergent tank and fill it with water only.\\nMaxExtract: As its name suggests, leaves carpets drier than the other machines. Allows you to rinse with water.\\nPowerScrub: Easiest emptying of the dirty water tank, which is very nice. Allows you to rinse with water.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\nIf you are cost conscious, buy the SteamVac. If you want the easiest experience, buy the PowerScrub. If you want dryer carpets quicker, buy the MaxExtract. You will get clean carpets with all three machines.\\n\\n***********************************************************\\nBelow is the review that I wrote in 2008 for the SteamVac:\\n\\nI read the reviews, and bought this model two weeks ago (August 2008). I've run 20 tanks of detergent through this machine cleaning rugs and carpets. Rather than repeat what you've read already, here's an update:\\n\\nThe \"Snap\": The clean water tank handle snaps into the machine to hold the tank in place. Mine never leaks.\\n\\nBoiling Water: Works great. I initially filled half the tank with boiling water. That worked well, so I dragged out the stew pot to fill the whole tank with boiling water. This worked even better: the waste water is even darker  brown as a result. It also seems that the waste water comes out of the carpet faster when you do this (fewer sucking laps). Boiling water is a winner.\\n\\nLeaks: Can't get this thing to leak. The tanks must have been redesigned.\\n\\nExtra laps to dry the carpet: This works. I noticed that a third drying lap sucked out more water (one lap with trigger depressed, then two laps just sucking). However, when using boiling water (see above), you want to keep the water as hot as possible. So go 1 lap with the trigger depressed, then 1 lap without, then move on. Come back later to suck out more water.\\n\\nDetergent and Pre-Treatment: The Hoover Deep Cleansing detergent that came with this machine worked well in conjunction with an enzyme-based pet spot remover. I ordered a gallon of the Hoover Premium Pet Formula, which works very well.\\n\\nTank Sizes: If you follow the instructions (one lap with trigger down, one lap without), the detergent tank will empty about when the waste tank is full. If you do extra laps to dry the carpet further, the waste tank will fill before the detergent tank is empty. Spraying a lot of pretreatment on your carpet will also result in the waste tank filling faster. This is a minor design flaw-the waste tank should have been bigger.\\n\\nCleaning the Waste Tank: I didn't understand why so many people complained about the difficulty of cleaning the waste tank. Hold it in your left hand. Spray water into it from your kitchen sink sprayer with your right hand. Twist your hands a little to get into the nooks and crannies. You'll be done in 60 seconds.   \n",

with Clean Surge, F5914900> end of Oct.\\nToday (11/10/13) was the first time I tried it to clean the carpet.\\nThe machine cleaned well, BUT some part of the machine didn't work properly.\\nThat is the <Brush Speed>, which has 3 options. They are SPILL PICKUP (left), GENTLE BRUSH (center) and POWER BRUSH (right).\\nWhen I started clean the carpet, I pushed the button to the center (gentle brush), before I turned on the power, the button stayed right in place.\\nWhen I ran it over the carpet just for few seconds, the button slided itself to the left (power brush).\\n\\nThen, I clean the dirty bucket and went ahead to dry the carpet. So, I pushed the button again to the right (SPILL PICKUP), the button slided again to the far right (power brush) when I ran it over to dry the carpet for few seconds.\\nOhhh....that made me felt very frustrated.\\nMaybe I didn't have luck to get a good working unit.\\n\\nAnother experience, I attached the hose to clean a spot, ohh....it wasn't an easy step, and took me so long to attach and detach the hose.\\nI do love Hoover vacuum, and that works great and picks up lots of dirt. I think I will still look around for a better model from Hoover selection to pick up another steamVac.   \n",

I purchased it to use in between my regular vacuuming to keep up with dog hair and the many crumbs that come with having small kids, It does such a good job that I found that I don't need to get out my large vacuum more than once a week AND I am done so much quicker since I don't have to take time to move a cord around to different outlets. It has a switch position for hard floor and carpet and the carpet mode has just enough suction to get everything up, but it isn't so strong it gets tangled in my rugs. It also fits under my end tables and kitchen cabinets very nicely and it has definitely far exceeded my expectations with its long lasting battery and excellent suction. All of this for under $100! I highly recommend this vacuum for small and large homes alike. It's awesome!   \n",

frequently) and a spouse who always forgets to take off his shoes when coming home. In addition we have \"fabulous\" orange clay in the backyard and our dogs think that digging in it is the greatest thing in the world. Even though we try to wipe their paws when they come in, there is always some orange left. Since my spouse and I are very busy we did not get to cleaning our carpets for two years. Disgusting, I know.\\nWe finally purchased this machine after reading a lot of reviews. I read the instructions carefully and got started using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-AH30120-Premium-Pet-Carpet-Upholstery-Detergent-128-ounces/dp/B002RONUXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover AH30120 Premium Pet Carpet & Upholstery Detergent, 128-ounces</a>.

I am so happy that we finally purchased a carpet cleaner.\\nI did have to fill and empty the water tanks quite frequently but that was manageable. The carpet dried really fast. I went over the wet carpet a lot and left the windows open. I do not think that the machine is heavy. I can't say anything about the longevity since we only used it for three rooms. I have never cleaned carpets in my life, therefore I can't compare this machine to any other. I really hope that this machine does not break early because I am so happy with it. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good value.   \n",

When he contacted the seller, he was told that really the unit was just an open box unit which had been used only once and returned, and the factory refurbished it like new. It was a little over $50.\\n\\nSo the problem started when we received the unit and the inside looked a little dirty. I immediately wanted to return it, but my husband didn't want to go to the trouble and he decided we should try it out. We have a three year old and our rental apartment is fully carpeted throughout, and we were both tired of our ugly carpet. We'd been spending $45 to rent steam cleaners from grocery stores about once every few months.\\n\\nSo I gave in.\\n\\nWe probably used it twice before the middle brush completely broke off. We were not in any way rough on the unit or irresponsible with it. I was cleaning with it and started hearing a weird noise underneath. I lifted the unit to inspect, and the middle brush fell right out without me even touching it. The stem had completely broken off. None of the brushes will turn now, I guess it needs all the brushes in place in order to turn? So to use the vacuum we have to use the hand attachments. Imagine cleaning the carpeting in a 1500 square foot apartment with only the hand attachments. A few more weeks of this and I'll have shoulders like a body builder.\\n\\nIt's too late to return with the warranty, since it took me a year to convince my husband that the brushes on the unit will not turn. So now I'm going to try buying a set of replacement brushes. We'll see how that goes. I will update my review after that. If that doesn't help I will have to take it to a vacuum cleaner repair shop. With all the money I'm going to have to spend, it would have been less expensive to just buy the thing brand new.\\n\\nAll that aside, it does clean well. Even just using the hand attachments. The first time we used it our carpet looked great. Almost as good as when we'd first moved in and the carpet had just been professionally cleaned. It dried much faster than the steam cleaners we had rented, but it didn't clean quite as deeply. The nap on our carpet did go back to looking new though, which does not happen with the hand attachments no matter how hard I scrub. Long story short, this thing cleans way better than just using a scrub brush and elbow grease, but not nearly as good as a professional cleaner. Ideally, one could keep their carpets clean with a weekly once-over. If one just so happened to have a working unit.\\n\\nI've used this on my couch and dining room chair upholstery and it works just fine. I've only used it with the Hoover Platinum cleaner and it did no damage to my upholstery. Not sure if I would try any other cleaners in case it bleached out the fabric.\\n\\nThanks to Pinterest, I found a recipe for a cleaner that works great with this unit, and is less expensive and works 10 times better than Hoover Platinum. Here's the recipe for anyone brave enough to try it. I suggest trying it on a small spot of your carpet just in case it bleaches it out or something. I had nothing to lose thanks to a paint mess my daughter made, so I tried it on my beige carpet and it worked perfectly.\\n\\n** Carpet Cleaner Recipe **\\n\\n2 tablespoons ammonia (or you can use windex if you aren't afraid of the blue dye)\\n1 teaspoon dish soap (i prefer dawn)\\n2 cups of rubbing alcohol\\na few drops of essential oil (for scent purposes. this is optional)\\n\\nMix together, add to tank, add HOT HOT HOT water on top.\\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nAnother recipe I use which is pretty much a miracle (I keep it in a spray bottle for a quick spot cleaning) is this:\\n\\n** Miracle Carpet Cleaner **\\n\\n1/2 cup ammonia\\n1/2 cup white distilled vinegar\\n1/2 cup mrs. meyers all purpose solution (i use the basil scent. it covers the awful ammonia smell)\\n3-4 tablespoons of dish soap\\n2 cups rubbing alcohol\\n\\nHopefully this is useful to someone!\\n\\n***\\n\\nNew information. You can purchase single replacement brushes and a full set of replacement brushes on here. Unfortunately after reading the reviews on those replacement brushes and after having had the experience I have had so far with my vacuum, I have to strongly recommend against buying this vacuum if you can help it. Next time I will try a different brand. I have had Hoover vacs in the past which I didn't like, so I'm not really surprised.\\n\\nHere's the set of replacement brushes&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-SteamVac-Brush-Block-5-Brushes-Part-48437022/dp/B001ICM7J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover SteamVac Brush Block - 5 Brushes Part # 48437022</a>\\n\\nHere's the single replacement brush&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hoover-Steam-Cleaner-Drive-Scrub-Brush-42-3800-57/dp/B008MKHDX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hoover Steam Cleaner Drive Scrub Brush 42-3800-57</a>\\n\\nI'm going to get the full set of replacement brushes, and if they fail again I'm just going to get rid of this whole thing and start over with a new brand of machine altogether. I don't want to spend more money than I would have buying it brand new only to have it keep on failing.   \n",

the unit where the scrub brushes are located. Unsure if its the dirty water or the water/solution. I haven't found a solution besides removing all tanks and leaving the unit in my bathtub for a few days until it stops leaking. Enclosed a picture of water leakage after only mere minutes.\\n\\nSo far so good!\\n\\nPros:\\n1. SUPER Easy to assemble, only requires you to screw in 2 screws (included) and push some thing in here and there.\\n2. Very easy to detach both the water tank and the dirty water tank.\\n3. Maneuvers very easily. Standard weight.\\n4. The cord was plenty long for me for my 15x11 room.\\n5. Did an AMAZING job cleaning my carpeting that hasn't been cleaned in at least 6 years (i know yuck).\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Didn't pick up all the hair in the carpeting, but left some clumps on the surface that should be a cinch to suck up with the vacuum.\\n2. Dirty water tank is small, it filled twice on a 15x11 room (with furniture in place so I'd say about half that size).\\n3. Solution goes fast, I filled it twice (however only used about 1.5 of it).\\n4. Water tank is small I filled it twice (three times actually but I went over the carpet with hot water first without solution to prime the carpet).\\n\\nIncluding a video of the dirty water tank dumping.   \n",
